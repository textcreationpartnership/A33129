            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I.</hi> An Epiſtle to the Author of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions upon <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was in my Journey in the North, far enough from <hi>London,</hi> when your <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> upon <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> came forth. Nor did I ever ſet eye upon them, till my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in <hi>February,</hi> about half a year after: which I tell you Sir, to excuſe my ſilence. And now in brief: For your labour I thank you; for your endeavour I pitty you; for your purpos I pardon you: that being as I beleve, intended for Gentlemens ſatisfaction, the othet for <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> his confutation, this for the <hi>Authors</hi> confuſion.</p>
            <p>I may not go about to reply unto you; becaus this would be againſt the very end and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> it ſelf, which ſpeaks forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then this, <hi>That Controverſies about Religion are vain and fruitleſs.</hi> And leſt this ſhould not be able to detain me from any ſuch reply, you adde your own threats, That if I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57771:3"/>ſhall dare to write again, you will make me know what manner of man you are. However Sir, let we crave leave to thank you for the paſtime your <hi>Animadverſions</hi> have given me ſince my return.</p>
            <p>But Sir, you miſtake the very drift and deſign of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which makes you to erre ever and anon, throughout your whole Book, whiles you take that as ſpoken abſolutely which is only ſaid upon an <hi>hypotheſis</hi> of our preſent condition here in <hi>England,</hi> diſtraction, diſputes, and wars, in order to a contrary end of unity, love, and concord, deſigned by <hi>Fiat Lux;</hi> and the Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popeia's brought in by me, as <hi>Solomòn</hi> in his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes</hi> makes the fool and atheiſt ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to ſpeak their minds, theſe you conceiv to be my doctrin. By vertu of theſe capital miſtakes, what by me is ſaid of the obſcurity of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Providence, is with you impertinent; that of Light and Spirit, impious; that of Plea of Parties, frivolous; that of Reaſon, diſſonant and to no purpos; that of Scripture blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; that of the Hiſtory of Religion, no leſs inconſequent than untrue. In a word, this thing, that thing, every thing, a wilde, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt illiterate diſcours.</p>
            <p>Some would wonder, that he who writes in confutation of a Book, ſhould be himſelf the only man that underſtands it not. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is apparent: It is your onely advantage to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57771:3"/>miſtake. The whole diſcours of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, one part with another, from that which is ſuppoſed to that which is deſigned, would breath ſo much of charity and ſobernes, that my <hi>Commentatour</hi> could not have told how to make <hi>any mad verſions</hi> upon it. It is not yet too late. Now that you have finiſhed your <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> or Comment, or Notes upon it, you may do well to take my Book again into your hands; read it calmly, and underſtand it.</p>
            <p>That which you ſpeak ſo frequently of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> his ignorance, is not altogether amiſs: for he pretends not much to learning, although he knows what he ſayes. But yet Sir, if you had defied and villified him with leſs violence, and more ſeldom, and not ſo univerſally in every point of hiſtory, language, and philoſophy, nor juſt then when you had leaſt caus, it had been more for your honour. A third part of your Book, which is taken up in talking of my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and other qualities, might well have been ſpared, had you had arguments to demonſtrate it.</p>
            <p>And in my minde you too much forget your ſelf, when you recount ſo often with regret and anger, that ſom gentlemen of the land ſhould through their own inconſideration, have any liking of a Book which you judg ſo ſlight, aiery, vain, fallacious, and ſimple. As if they had none, and you all the judgment of diſcerning.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57771:4"/>Gentlemen, Sir, muſt be allowed a ſens of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as Miniſters; and their portion of reaſon muſt not therfor be leſs, becaus their Blood is more noble, the company they keep more accompliſht, and their education better. They have the body, although they wear not the Cloak of Religion, and maſters they are of their own reaſon, tho not of yours. This is one difference between Catholik countreys and ours; that there the Clergy-man is only regarded for his vertue &amp; the power he hath received, or is at leaſt believed to have received from God in the great miniſtery of our reconciliation. And if he have any addition of learning beſides, it is looked upon as a good accidental ornament, but not as any eſſential complement of his Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that it often happens, without any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment at all, that the Gentleman Patron is the learned man, and the Prieſt his Chaplain of little or no ſcience in compariſon. But here in <hi>England</hi> our Gentlemen are diſparaged by their own Black Coats; and not ſuffered to uſe their judgments in any kinde of learning, without a gybe from them. The Gentleman is reaſonles, and the ſcribling Caſſock is the only Schollar: he alone muſt ſpeak all, know all, and only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>I cannot but ſmile to ſee you turn ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly every thing that is ſaid in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> to your own uſe. His diſcours of innocence and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57771:4"/>moderation, gives you occaſion to ſpeak, and amply dilate of wars, murders, adulteries, lyes, hypocriſies, villanies: And when he cries, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> it is motive enough for you to cry, <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Daggers.</hi> You rave and rage againſt him and the whole earth; you load your pen and pages with the tyrannies, deſolations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders have been aforetime in the world, not heeding that you had not ſo much as heard at this day of any ſuch abuſes, if their holy and renowned Clergy-men, who ſtill declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vices of their times, had not left them upon record; or ſo much as conſidering, that even now in theſe beſt times of Reformation are as grand diſorders in all kindes as ever were in the worſt times of Popiſh corruption.</p>
            <p>Nay there was never any crow or magpie ſo pecked and cawed upon the back of a ſheep, as you do upon <hi>Fiat Lux;</hi> and if he do but ſtir or wag, you threaten, if I underſtand you right, to peck out his eyes. And all this, becauſe <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> endeavours to ſhow, that animoſities about matters of Religion are groundleſs, prejudicial to peace and neighbourhood, ruinous, deſolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, endles, and conſequently vain, fruitles, and ſinful; (ther may indeed be ſom advantage on the Defendants ſide, which is not in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff or Actour, but this at preſent I am not to take notice of) nay finally, that they have ever don much harm in Kingdoms, but never good.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57771:5"/>In all this Sir, you do like your ſelf, you love nois and whirlwinds, and when you hear of <hi>Peace,</hi> prepare your ſelf to <hi>Battle:</hi> ſo ill do you underſtand the ſound of a retreat, or, becaus it ſuits not with your ends and inclinations, will not.</p>
            <p>But all this diſcours of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> tends, ſay you, to <hi>Popery.</hi> A fearful thing, and ungrateful news to Miniſters; for whoſe fooliſh, endles, and ungrounded quarrels, we have lately enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our honour, peace, livelihood, lives, and all that is dear unto us; and yet we are ſtill, but where we were before we began. Nay, we are ten times farther off from any reconcilement, unity, or ſatisfaction then before. And ſuch ſucceſs have all wars ever had, where the alarm was given in the Pulpit. But why muſt it tend to Popery? Becaus that <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> is bold to ſay, that <hi>Popery</hi> in its own likenes is not ſo ugly as we imagin it. Lord! what a ſtrange thing is this, that either <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> or any els ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, that we in <hi>England,</hi> or other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be carried by the reports of ſom inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted men, to think wors of a thing then it may deſerv; eſpecially conſidering that we com all to Church to hear Gods Words, and there meet with a man, who in the firſt opening of his lips, cryes, <hi>Hearken my Beloved to the word of the Lord;</hi> and ſo having with that airy honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb ſweetned the edges of our ears, pours into
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57771:5"/>them afterward what poiſon of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intereſts he pleaſes; all which we his <hi>dearly beloved</hi> let down greedily into our hearts, as that precious word of the Lord which he at firſt proclaimed. By which fallacies, we have been in the time of theſe our late wars, ſo far inveigled, (I ſpeak to men now alive, who all know I ſpeak true) that it became then a moſt dangerous thing, yea, treaſon it ſelf, to ſay, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> who was by this our Pulpit rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick made as odious then throughout the land, as Popery, what ever it be, ever was or can be. And are not neighbours thus abuſed daily almoſt in every thing? Where is that man, who hath not by ſuch like means been one time or other induced to think amiſs, even of his moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and deareſt friends, till himſelf by trial found the contrary? <hi>O but God forbid,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>that ever we ſhould come by trial to know what Popery is.</hi> Sir, may it be far from us, ſo long as heaven pleaſes. But i'th interim, what harm can it be to us to mitigate our paſſions? which if there be no miſtake, are prejudicial notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to our own peace; and if a miſtake there ſhould be, are double injurious, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſinful before God and man. <hi>Oh but miſtake there can be none!</hi> Sir, let me tell you roundly. By your own Book of <hi>Animadverſions</hi> I do as clearly ſee, as ever I beheld Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that you do not your ſelf underſtand what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57771:6"/>
               <hi>Popery</hi> is; even no more, then the pooreſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt peaſant in the Pariſh. But who is able to make this good and clear unto you? no body Sir, ſo long as you are in paſſion, in a calm of indifferency your very ſelf. Nor could I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſerenity, have been ever able to diſcern it. But yet, there is one thing more, which will hinder your acknowledgement, although you ſhould come to know it. It is their intereſt to juſtifie themſelvs, and yours to condemn them.</p>
            <p>Had not you with your threats ſo much fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from any thought of writing any more, I could I think my ſelf, who am in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one of the greateſt ingrams in the Land, make it yet appear, that the preſent Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if to pleas you they will give me leave to call it ſo, is not only leſs ugly then we conceive it, but far more innocent and amiable then I have made it. And, if there were not ſo much as one Catholik, or Romaniſt, or Papiſt upon earth, yet ſo far am I from any intereſt herein, that in that judgment I would notwithſtanding dy alone. Nor had I ſet before my eyes any other end in that my <hi>Fiat</hi> of moderation, againſt which you write your hot <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> then the peace and welfar of my Countrey, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretended ſhadow of Popery, inflamed by the alarms of <hi>Vicars</hi> and their <hi>Wives,</hi> for whom we fight as it were <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> hates and miſchieſs, ſtrikes and deſtroyes one another
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57771:6"/>without end. And yet, which is a ſtrange thing, whilſt every one conceits himſelf to fight for <hi>Purity</hi> of Goſpel againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> they fight all for <hi>Popery</hi> againſt <hi>Purity</hi> of Goſpel. And this you muſt affirm your ſelf, if you do but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what in your Book of <hi>Animadverſions</hi> you ſo frequently aſſert; that what good ſoever the <hi>Papiſts</hi> or Roman Catholiks either do or have amongſt them, they have and do the ſame as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and not as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and that Popery is it ſelf nothing els, but pride, intereſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tyranny, worldly reſpects, thirſt of blood, affectation of dominion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As I am ſure on the other ſide, that grace, charity, and peace is the pure quinteſſence of Goſpel, and the very extract of true Religion. Either then I had reaſon to tell you, that you underſtand not what <hi>Popery</hi> is; or if you do, you muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that thoſe who here in <hi>England,</hi> betwixt the years of 1640. and 1660. with guns and daggers, as you often phraſe it, with field rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick and pulpit cannon, ſubverted all before them, even Church and State too, let them call themſelvs <hi>Puritans, Independents, Presbyterians,</hi> or what they pleas, were all of them by this your own rule, as <hi>arch Papiſts</hi> as ever trode upon the earth. Nor is it of concernment, ſo they have the reality of the thing, whence they may borrow their name; whether ſome man upon earth be their <hi>Pope,</hi> or whether the <hi>Devil</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57771:7"/>be himſelf their ghoſtly father.</p>
            <p>And I fear Sir, you wer your ſelf ſome part of that diſmal tempeſt; which in the laſt years of our woful <hi>Anarchy</hi> overbore all before it, not only Church and State, but reaſon, right, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, all true Religion, and even good natur too. The very flaſhings of your pen move me to this thought. The whole phyſiognomy of your Book ſpeaks the hot and fiery ſpirit of the Authour. Firſt, you cannot abide to hear of <hi>moderation,</hi> it is with you moſt wicked, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and devilliſh, eſpecially as it coms from me. And for this one thing <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſuffers more from you, then for all the contents of the Book put together. My reaſon is your paſſion; my moderation inflames your wrath; and you are therfor ſtark wild, becaus I utter ſo much of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. Secondly, your ſo frequent talking of <hi>ſword and blood, fire and faggot, guns and daggers,</hi> do more then ſhow, you have not yet let go thoſe hot and furious imaginations. It is a phraſe ſo ordinary with you, that when another writer of your own judgment would have told me, that my words are falſe or beſides the purpos, or the like, you in a phraſe of your own tell me ſtill that I ſpeak guns and daggers. <hi>If he mean,</hi> ſay you of me, p 27. <hi>that ther is in good works an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal worth, &amp;c. he ſpeaks daggers, and doth not himſelf beleev what he ſayes.</hi> And again, p. 94. <hi>For men to come now in the end of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57771:7"/>world, and tell us, That we muſt reſt in the autority of the preſent Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is to ſpeak daggers and ſwords to us, upon a confidence that we will ſuffer our ſelves to be befoold.</hi> So likewiſe p. 340. <hi>He tells us,</hi> ſay you of me, <hi>it is good to prefer a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation before the Originals. What ſhall we do with thoſe men that ſpeak ſuch ſwords and daggers, and are well neither full nor faſting.</hi> I pray Sir where did you borrow this trope? had you it from the ſchool of Ariſtotle, or Mars his camp?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, your prophetick <hi>aſſurance</hi> ſo often inculcated, that if <hi>you could but once com to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per me in the ear, I would plainly acknowledg, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I underſtand not my ſelf what I ſay, or if I do, beleev it not,</hi> givs a fair character of thoſe fanatick times, wherin ignorance and hypocriſy prevailed over worth and truth; wherof if your ſelf wer any part, it is no wonder you ſhould think that I or any man els, ſhould either ſpeak he knows not what, or beleev not, what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks. It was the proper badg of thoſe times, when after the alarm ſounded in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, that our people therupon went forth in troops to battle, neither did the peaſant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor the man in black beleev, although the ſound rung generally in their ears, that it was <hi>the ſword of the Lord and of Gideon,</hi> which they brandiſht againſt the loyal band, their foes. Meaſuring me it ſeems by your ſelf, you tell me no leſs than ſeaven times in your book, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57771:8"/>I beleev not, and I think ſeaventy times, that I underſtand not what I ſpeak my ſelf. It is a kind of charity in you to think your neighbour is as you know your ſelf to be. But I do not much care for that charity, except you were better than I find you are.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, your pert aſſertion ſo often occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in your book, that <hi>ther is neither reaſon, truth, nor honeſty in my words,</hi> is but the overflowing of that former intemperat zeal: and the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent it occurs, the leſs approbation it will find. Fiftly, your ſharp and frequent menaces, that if I write or ſpeak again, I ſhall hear more, find more, feel more, more to my ſmart, more than I imagin, more than I would, relliſhes too much of that inſulting humour our bleeding Land then groaned under, the many years of our anarchical confuſion. Sixthly, the abſence of your <hi>name</hi> in the frontiſpiece of your book, which I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before obſerved in all my life of any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant writer, that hath ever in my time ſet forth a book here in <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery, givs no ſmall ſuſpicion that the Authour of our <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſione</hi> is no ſuch <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as he would be thought to be. Laſtly, that I may omit other ſpecial reaſons, your other general trick of charging me then moſt of all with <hi>fraud, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and wickedneſs,</hi> when in your own heart you find me moſt clear from any ſuch blemiſh, thereby to put a vail upon your own caus, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57771:8"/>would otherways be diſparaged, makes me ſmell a fox, a notorious one. <hi>Sic notus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> This has been too often acted here in <hi>England</hi> to be ſoon forgotten. The better the caus, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtill was the cry againſt thoſe who ſtood for it; that the bluſtering nois of calumnies might drown all report of their innocence. And by all this I cannot Sir but ſuſpect, that if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Popery your Animadverſions givs us be right, you are a Papiſt your ſelf, and no true Proteſtant, a notorious Papiſt. But as it is, ſo let it be.</p>
            <p>Thus much I only tell you, that you may ſee I am neither neglective of your book, nor idle; but have peruſed and read it over. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though what for the threats of your <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,</hi> and what for the reaſons of my own <hi>Fiat,</hi> I may not enter into controverſie: yet I hope I may let you know that I have ſeen your work. And that you may the better credit me, I will give you a ſhort account of it, firſt in general, then in particular. And this is all I mean here to do.</p>
            <p>The whole deſign of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> you do utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake, throughout all your book of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions;</hi> ſo that you conceiv that to be a controverſy, which is none; that to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, which is but hypothetically diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the exceptions of other men; that to be only for one ſide, which is indifferently for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57771:9"/>all; although I ſpeak moſt for them that are moſt ſpoken againſt, and am in very deed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely againſt all ſpeaking, quarrelling, diſputing about Religion. If you will but have patience to hear my purpos and deſign, which to all men not intereſted and blinded with a prejudice, is clear enough relucent in the whole context of my <hi>Fiat,</hi> what I ſay will eaſily appear to your ſelf. <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſayes one thing, and ſuppoſes it; another thing he deſires and aims at: that he diſlikes; this he commends. We are at this day at variance about Religion, this <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But it were better to have peace; this he aims at and deſires. And both theſe things are intermingled up and down in my book, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that ſmall faculty that God hath given me, though not according to the uſual method that is found now adayes in books. Here Sir in few words you have the ſumme of my <hi>Fiat.</hi> And I hope you will grant that to be the ſcope of my book, which I made it for. That we are now at variance is moſt clear and certain; by me ſuppoſed, and not to be denied. And that it were better to have peace, is as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expedient, as the other is evidently true. Theſe then being things both of them which no man can reſiſt; either by denying the one, or diſliking the other; I thought them better intermingled then ſet apart; and with more reaſon to be ſuppoſed, then induſtriouſly proved.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57771:9"/>Yet to ſuperinduce a diſpoſition unto peace, my only work was to demonſtrate an uſeleſnes, an endleſnes, an unprofitablenes of quarrels, which I laboured quite through my book; beginning it with an intimation of our quarrels, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the fruits and works of the fleſh; and ending it with a commendation of charity, which is the great fruit and bleſſing of Gods holy Spirit. Now the eaſier to perſwade my Countreymen to a belief both of the one and the other, firſt is inſinuated in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> both the ill grounds and worſt effects of feuds; then is the plea of parties ſpecified; their probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities acknowledged; and laſtly an impoſſibility of ever bringing our debates to a concluſion, either by light or ſpirit, reaſon or ſcriptur texts, ſo long as we ſtand ſeparated from any ſuperiour judicative power, unto which all parties will ſubmit, is I think with a ſtrong probability, if not demonſtrative evidence concluded. And therfor is it thought by <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> to be more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Chriſtian-like, to leav theſe endles, groundles, and ruinous contentions, and reſign our ſelvs to humility and peace. This is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and whole ſumme of my book. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſpeak up and down, here for <hi>Papiſts,</hi> there for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> elſwhere for <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independants,</hi> commonly out of the very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes they make for themſelvs; yet do I not defend either their wayes, or their arguments.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57771:10"/>Nor do I teach any doctrin at all, or hold there any opinion. But I only giv to underſtand in that one little book, what is largely diſcourſed in a hundred, <hi>That all parties do make out to themſelves ſuch a probability, which as it ſtands joyned with the actours reſolution, and ſeparated from any ſuperiour viſible power to which they will ſubmit, can never be ſubdued.</hi> And hath not long experience proved this as true as any thing els? What then is ther in <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied? Is it not evident that we are now at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? and too long indeed have been. Is it not alſo clear, that peace, charity, and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is better then variance, diſſention, and wars? Do not parties ſtrongly plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, ſo far perſwaded each one that himſelf is in the right, that he will not yield, the truth to be with any but himſelf. Is not all this evident? I am ſure it is; and all <hi>England</hi> will witnes it.</p>
            <p>And if any one ſhould be able to evince, that any reaſonings made in <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> either for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Proteſtants,</hi> or others, be not certain, or perhaps not probable; yet he does nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be able to prove likewiſe, that they are not probable to <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> or to thoſe that uſe them, whether <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Papiſts;</hi> which he can no more do, than he can pull a ſtar out of the firmament. I ſay Sir again, and mark I pray you, what I ſay. If you ſhould chance to evince
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57771:10"/>that the reaſons brought by <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> either for the doctrin or practiſes of Papiſts or others, be either not probable or untrue, yet is your labour all in vain, except you be able to demonſtrate likewiſe, that they are not probable to <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> or to Papiſts and others who uſe thoſe reaſons; which you can no more do, then any thing that is abſolutely impoſſible. By this time Sir, you may diſcern how hard it is to deal with <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> and impoſſible to confute him. Sith he ſpeaks nothing, but what is as clearly true and evident, as what we ſee at mid-day. Nor do I in this any way exalt the ability of the Authour, whom you are pleaſed ſo much and frequently to diſable. A Tom-fool may ſay that, which all the wiſemen in the world cannot gain-ſay: as he did, who ſaid the Sun was higher at noon, than any other hour of the day. It was <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> his fortune rather then chois, to utter words which will no ſooner be read, than acknowledged. And it was your misfortune Sir, to employ your greater talents in refuting evident truths; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for no other reaſon, but becaus they iſſued from the pen of a man, who is not ſo great a friend to faction, as you could wiſh. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you proceed very harſh and furiouſly; yet am I verily perſwaded, you now diſcern, though too late for your credit, that you had all this while, according to our Engliſh proverb, good Mr. Doctor, a wrong ſow by the ear.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57771:11"/>Thus far in general. Now briefly to give you ſom account in particular.</p>
            <p>You ſpend four Chapters, and a hundred and eighteen pages, which is the fourth part of your book, before you com to the firſt line and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff of mine, <hi>The applaus and honour of this world,</hi> &amp;c. And it is not unwittily done. For being to be led, as you heavily complain, out of your ordinary road of controverſies, by the wilde chaſe of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> it behoved you to draw ſom general common places of your own, for your ſelf to walk in, and exerciſe your rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and anger, before you purſue a bird that flies not, you ſay, in any uſual tract.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preface from page</hi> 1. <hi>to page</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Your preface, wherin you ſpeak of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and your own pretence, affords me nothing but the beginning of your own miſtake, which will run quite through your book.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Chap. from page</hi> 19. <hi>to</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>Your firſt chapter beats me about the pate, for ſaying that I conceal my method, with a terrible ſyllogiſtical dilemma, <hi>He that uſeth no method,</hi> ſay you, <hi>cannot conceal it,</hi> and <hi>if he hath concealed it, he hath uſed one.</hi> But I muſt paſs by ſtore of ſuch doughty ſtuff, being only fit for the young <hi>Oxford</hi> Schollar, who being com home to take air, would prove before his father and mother, that two eggs were three. Then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57771:11"/>going on you deny, that <hi>Proteſtants ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the doctrin and merit of good works;</hi> which at firſt I wondered at, ſeeing the ſound of it has rung ſo often in mine own ears, and ſo many hundred books written in this laſt age, ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently witnes it in all places, till I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in my thorow peruſal of your book, that you neither heed what you ſay, or how much you do deny. But you perhaps love to talk of them better than your fore-fathers did, though your thoughts be all the ſame. And you will all equally bleſs your ſelvs from building of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as the Papiſts have don, however your prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle goes.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Chap. from page</hi> 29. <hi>to</hi> 110.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond chapter collects out of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> as you ſay, ten general concluſions, ſpread all over like veins and arteries, in the body of that my book. And this you do, that you may make your ſelf a <hi>campus Martius</hi> to ſport in, without confinement to my method. But you name not any page of my book, where thoſe principles may all or any of them be found. And you do wifely: For in the ſence thoſe words do either naturally make out, or in which you underſtand them, of all the whole ten I cannot own any one for mine own, ſet down in my book. The firſt of my principles muſt be this, <hi>That we received the Goſpel firſt from</hi> Rome. In your ſence I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke this. We, that is, we Engliſh firſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57771:12"/>received it thence. But you talk againſt it, as if I meant that Brittans had it firſt from <hi>Rome. We had it not firſt from Rome,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but by Joſeph of Arimathea from Paleſtin, as Fiat Lux himſelf acknowledges.</hi> Sir, if <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſay both theſe things, he cannot mean in your contradictory fals ſence, but in his own true one. We, that is, we Engliſhmen, the now actual inhabitants of this Land, and progeny of the Saxons, received firſt our Goſpel and Chriſtendom from <hi>Rome;</hi> though the Brittans who inhabited this Land before us, differing as much from us as <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> had ſome of them been Chriſtned long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. And yet the Chriſtendom that prevailed and laſted among the Brittans, even they alſo as well as we, had it from <hi>Rome</hi> too: mark this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But you reply, <hi>Though perſons from Rome did firſt plant Chriſtianity among the Saxons, was it the Popes Religion they taught? did the Pope firſt finde it out? or did they Baptiſe in the name of the Pope?</hi> Good Sir, it was the Popes Religion, not invented by him, as your cavil fondly imagines, but owned, profeſſed, and put in practice by him, and from him derived unto us by his miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. You adde, <hi>Did not the Goſpel come to Rome as well as to us? for it was not firſt preached there.</hi> Sir, properly ſpeaking, it came not ſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> as it came to us. For one of the twelve foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, nay two of the thirteen, and thoſe the largeſt and greateſt, was transferred to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57771:12"/>which they watered with their blood: we had never any ſuch ſtanding fountain of Chriſtian Religion here, but only a ſtream derived to us from thence.</p>
            <p>My ſecond aſſertion muſt be, <hi>From whom we firſt received our Religion, with them we muſt ſtill abide.</hi> This principle as it is never delivered by <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> though you put it upon me, ſo is it in the latitude it carries, and wherin you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, abſolutely fals, never thought of by me, and indeed impoſſible. For how can we abide with them in any truth, who may perhaps not abide in it themſelvs. Great part of <hi>Flanders</hi> was firſt converted by Engliſhmen, and yet are they not obliged, either by <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> or any <hi>lux</hi> whatſoever, to accompany the Engliſh in our now preſent wayes. If <hi>Rome</hi> firſt taught us Chriſtianity, ſhe may then rather plead a power to guide us, than we her. This or ſome ſuch like thing I might ſpeak, and rationally ſpeak it. But that we or any other ſhould be obliged ſtill to abide or rather to follow them who firſt taught us Religion, though they ſhould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs forſake their own doctrin, as you would make me ſpeak, is a piece of folly never came into my thoughts. And you may be aſhamed to put it upon me: Why do you not ſet down my own words, and the page of my book where I delivered this principle.</p>
            <p>My third muſt be, <hi>The Roman Religion is ſtill
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57771:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſame.</hi> This alſo I do no where formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, nor enter into any ſuch common place: You will ſay I ſuppoſe it. But doth this juſtifie you who ſay here, that I aſſert it as a principle; let it then be ſuppoſed, for I do indeed ſuppoſe it, becaus I know it hath been demonſtrativly proved a hundred times over. You deny it has bin proved, why do you not then diſprove it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus <hi>you decline,</hi> ſay you, <hi>all common places.</hi> Very good, ſo do I; let us com to proper ones. You fall then upon my Queries in the end of my book. <hi>The Roman was once a true flouriſhing Church, and if ſhe ever fell, ſhe muſt fall either by apoſtaſie, hereſie, or ſchiſm, &amp;c.</hi> So I ſpeak there. And to this you reply, that <hi>the Church that then was in the Apoſtles time, was indeed true, not that Roman Church that now is.</hi> So, ſo; then ſay I, that former true Church muſt fall then, ſom time or other; when did ſhe fall, and how did ſhe fall? by apoſtacy, hereſy, or ſchiſm? <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi> ſay you, <hi>neither way: for ſhe might fall by an earthquake.</hi> Sir, we ſpeak not here of any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual or natural downfall or death of mortals by plague, famine, or earthquake, but a moral and voluntary laps in faith. What do you ſpeak to me of earthquakes! You adde therfor the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, that <hi>ſhe might fall by idolatry; and ſo neither by apoſtacy, hereſy, or ſchiſm.</hi> Good Sir, idolatry is a mixt miſdemeanour both in faith and manners: I ſpeak of the ſingle one of faith.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57771:13"/>And he that falls by idolatry, if he keep ſtill ſome parts of Chriſtianity entire, he falls by hereſy; by apoſtacy, if he keep none. At laſt finding your ſelf puſled, in the third place you lay on load; <hi>She fell,</hi> ſay you, <hi>by apoſtacy, idolatry, hereſy, ſchiſm, licentiouſnes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenes of life.</hi> And in this you do, not much unlike the drunken youth, who being bid to hit his maſters finger with his, when he perceived he could not do it, he ran his whole fiſt againſt it. But did ſhe fall by apoſtacy? <hi>By a partial one,</hi> ſay you, <hi>not a total one.</hi> Good Sir, in this diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, apoſtaſy is ſet to expres a total relaps; in oppoſition to hereſy, which is the partial. Did ſhe then fall by hereſy, or partial apoſtaſy, in adhering to any error in faith, contary to the approved doctrin of the Church? Here you ſmile ſeriouſly, and tell me, that <hi>ſince I take the Roman and Catholik Church to be one, ſhe could not indeed adhere to any thing but what ſhe did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto.</hi> Sir I take them indeed to be one; but here I ſpeak <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to one that does not take them ſo. And then, if indeed the Roman Church had ever ſwerved in faith, as you ſay ſhe has, and be her ſelf but as another ordinary particular Church, as you ſay ſhe is; then might you find ſom one or other more general Church, if any ther were, poſſitively to judg her; ſom Oecumenical councel to condemn her; ſom fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers either greek or latin, expreſly to write
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57771:14"/>againſt her, as Proteſtants now do; ſom or other grave ſolemn autority to cenſur her; or at leaſt ſom company of beleevers out of whoſe body ſhe went, and from whoſe faith ſhe fell. Since you are no wayes able to aſſign any of theſe particulars, my Query remains unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Roman ſtill as flouriſhing a Church, as ever ſhe was.</p>
            <p>The fourth aſſertion, <hi>frequently,</hi> ſay you, <hi>pleaded by our Authour is; that all things as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were ever quiet and in peace, before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants relinquiſhment of the Roman Sea.</hi> This principle you pretend is drawn out of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> not becaus it is there; but only to open a door for your ſelf, to expatiate into ſom wide general diſcours, about the many wars, diſtractions, and factious altercations, that have been aforetime up and down the world, in ſom ſeveral ages of Chriſtianity: And you therfor ſay <hi>it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded by me,</hi> becaus indeed I never ſpeak one word of it. And it is in truth a fals and fond aſſertion. Though neither you nor I can deny, that ſuch as keep unity of faith with that Church, can never ſo long as they hold it, fall out upon that account. If you had either cited the place, or ſet down my own words, they would have ſpoke their meaning. I might ſay perhaps, that our Land had no part of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances upon the account of religion all the thouſand years it was Catholik, which it hath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57771:14"/>ſuffered in one age ſince, or the like. But that all things ſhould ever be at quiet throughout the world, that ther ſhould no hereſies riſe, no ſeditions, no wars any where; this is a fanſy that was never in my head; and I wonder how it ſhould drop into my paper. But you are a martial man, and reſolved to bring me in with pikes and guns, as the red-coat ſouldiers did the Cavaliers in the time of our late anarchy, to ſuffer not only for the good they acted, but for the ill they never thought of.</p>
            <p>Fift muſt be, <hi>that the firſt reformers were moſt of them contemptible perſons, their means indirect, and ends ſiniſter.</hi> Where is it Sir, where is it, that I meddle with any mens perſons, or ſay they are contemptible, or their means indirect, or ends ſiniſter? Where do I ſay all this? Do I ſpeak any word of Reformers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in general, as you make me to do. But this you adde of your own, in a vaſt univerſal noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end you may bring in the apoſtles and prophets, and kings, into the liſt of perſons by me ſurnamed contemptible, and liken my ſpeech, who never ſpeak any ſuch thing, to the ſarcaſms of <hi>Celſus, Lucian, Porphiry, Julian,</hi> and other Pagans.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe in the very beginning of this your ſecond chapter you ſpend four leaves in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel betwixt me and the pagan <hi>Celſus,</hi> wherof ther is not any one member of it true. <hi>Doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57771:15"/>Fiat Lux,</hi> ſay you, <hi>lay the caus of all the troubles, diſorders, tumults, wars within the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope upon the Proteſtants? Doth he charg the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that by their ſchiſms and ſeditions they make a way for other revolts? doth he gather a rapſody of inſignificant words? doth he inſiſt upon their diviſions? doth he mannage the argument of the Jews againſt Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So doth Celſus, who is confuted by learned Origen,</hi> &amp;c. Where does <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> where does he, does he, does he any ſuch thing? Are you not aſhamed to talk at this rate? I give a hint indeed of the diviſions that be amongſt us, and the frequent argumentations that are made to embroil and puſle one another, with our much evil, and little appearance of any good, in order to unity and peace, which is the end of my diſcours. But muſt I therfor be <hi>Celſus?</hi> Did <hi>Celſus</hi> do any ſuch thing to ſuch an end? It is the end that moraliſes and ſpecifies the action. To diminiſh Chriſtianity by upbraiding our frailties is paganiſh: to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort to unity by repreſenting the inconvenience of faction, is a Chriſtian and pious work. When honeſt Proteſtants in the Pulpit ſpeak ten times more full and vehemently againſt the diviſions, wars, and contentions that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, than ever came into my thoughts; muſt they therfor be, every one of them a <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> a pagan <hi>Celſus?</hi> what ſtuff is this! But it is not only my defamation you aim at, your own
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57771:15"/>glory coms in the reer. If I be <hi>Celſus,</hi> the pagan <hi>Celſus;</hi> then muſt you forſooth be <hi>Origen</hi> that wrote againſt him, honeſt <hi>Origen.</hi> That is the thing. Pray Sir, it is but a word, let me me adviſe you by the way, that you do not forget your ſelf in your heat, and give your wife occaſion to fall out with you. However you may, yet will not ſhe like it perhaps ſo well, that her husband ſhould be <hi>Origen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſixt principle muſt be, <hi>That our departure from Rome hath been the caus of all our evils.</hi> This is but the ſame with the fourth, in other words, but added for one to make up the number. And it is, you ſay, <hi>every where ſpread over the face of Fiat Lux.</hi> Sir you may ſay what you pleas, to be in his face, but I know beſt what is in the heart and bowels, both of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> and his Authour. And ſure I am this never came into my thoughts. Our diſſentions in faith may well multiply, as we ſee with our eyes they do, by our further depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur from unity; and this may caus much evil. But the branches of our too too manifold evils found among the ſons of men, ſpread all, as <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> alſo ſpeaks, from that fertil root of our innate concupiſcence, which by evil cuſtoms ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes up into a thick bole of vitious inclinations, while we ſtudy not to impair, but rather to augment and nouriſh it. However I muſt give you leave to number this among my ſilly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to the end you may talk more copiouſly of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57771:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>the diſputes, and wars and broils that are and have been in ſeveral parts of Chriſtendom, and fall again into your much affected and often ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſtrain. <hi>So the Pagans judged the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c. And I muſt ſtill be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and you the Primitive Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Seventh is, <hi>There is no remedy of our evils, but by a returning to the Roman Sea.</hi> This and the principle foregoing, had not you warily cloven a hair, had been all one, and both are equally mine. But Sir, that may remedy our difference in faith, which neither can nor will prevent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in philoſophy or other worldly judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor conſidering the infinite diverſity of mens humours, is there any one thing equally prevalent with all men, and at all times, to the like good effect; and if it do certainly help one evil, it is not therfor a remedy for all. But it ſeems you have yet a little more mirth and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to vent, and therfor I muſt permit you to adde this principle for mine, that you may ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſider, how the Romans ſhould cure our evils, that cannot prevent diſorders, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and ſins amongſt themſelvs. I can tell you Sir another remedy of our evils, that we ſuffer about diſſentions in Religion, beſides that. If the King and Parliament would pleas to give back all the eccleſiaſtical livings into the hands of ſecular gentlemen, who out of a blind zeal, as you phraſe it, gave them up afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57771:16"/>unto the pious uſes of ſpirituall men now no more extant, all our controverſies and the evils thence enſuing would ſoon ceas. Even you zealous Sir, would be then as quiet, as a wolf tumbled into a pit-fall. Other remedies I could yet acquaint you with, more than one or two. If you did Sir really, and not in words only acknowledge any one ſuperiour governour in the land, unto whoſe power and judgment you would heartily all of you reſign, the word of that Oracle would ſolve all doubts, and end all your quarrels. But you will never do it. The very genius of the Reformation is wholly ſet againſt it.</p>
            <p>The eight follows, <hi>That Scriptur on ſundry accounts is inſufficient to ſettle us in the truth.</hi> And in this you flouriſh and triumph moſt copiouſly for fifteen pages together, as the champion of the word of God. But Sir, you ſpeak not one word to the purpos, or againſt me at all, if I had delivered any ſuch principle, which I never did. Gods word is both the ſufficient and only neceſſary means both of our converſion and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement as well in truth as vertue. But Sir, the thing you heed not, and unto which I only ſpeak, if I any where hint at ſuch a thing, is this: If the Scriptur be in two hands, for example of the Proteſtant Church in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Puritan, who with that ſcriptur roſe up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt her, can the ſcriptur alone of it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57771:17"/>ſelf decide the buſines, how ſhall it do it, has it ever don it? or can that written word now ſolitary and in private hands ſo ſettle any in a way that neither himſelf nor preſent adherents, nor future generations ſhall queſtion it, or with as much probability diſſent from it either total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or in part, as himſelf firſt ſet it. This Sir is the caſe, unto which you do neither here nor in all your whole book ſpeak one word. And what you ſpeak otherwis of the Scripturs excellency, I allow it for good. What is not againſt me, is with me. But no law whatſoever, whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or humane can be a ſufficient rule to men, if no judge overſee it.</p>
            <p>Ninth, <hi>The Pope is a good man, and ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our good.</hi> This alſo I no where aver. I might mention the care and induſtry of that Sea, and affirm it to be unworthily traduced. But I never ſaw any Pope, nor have I any ſuch acquaintance with him, as to know whether he be a good man in your ſence or no, free from pride, anger, covetouſnes, &amp;c. though in charity I do not uſe to judg hardly of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Much leſs could I ſay, that he whom I know to have a general ſolicitude for all Churches, ſeeks nothing but our good. Sir, if I had pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my words in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> no better than you heed yours in your <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon it, they might even go together both of them to lap pepper and ſpice, or ſom other yet more vile employment.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57771:17"/>
            <p> Tenth, that <hi>the devotion of Catholiks far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends that of Proteſtants.</hi> But Sir I never made in <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> any compariſon between their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor do I remember that I ever ſo much as mentioned the devotion of Proteſtants. But you are the maddeſt <hi>Commentatour</hi> I have ever ſeen, you firſt make the <hi>Text,</hi> and then <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon it. Here at length you conclude your chapter, and <hi>would,</hi> ſay you, <hi>your book alſo; if you had none to deal with, but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and judicious readers.</hi> It ſeems what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, is for readers neither judicious nor inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious. And becaus I knew you took me for one of thoſe, I went on in my view. Indeed, had I not undertaken to give you an account of your whole book, I could have been well content to ſtop here with ingenious and judicious readers, and look no further. Doubtles in this affair good wits will jump. You would write no more, had you none but judicious readers; and theſe will read no more, becaus they are judicious. But I poor aſs muſt jogge on.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 110. <hi>to</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>Your third chapter concerns my preface, which in part you allow, and partly diſlike. And I am equally content with both.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>or</hi> 5 <hi>ch from page</hi> 119. <hi>to</hi> 148.</p>
            <p>Your fourth chapter by miſtake of preſs is named fift, and ſo I muſt here call it. It begins my book, and takes up five of my paragraffs at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57771:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>once. You have loitered long about the gate like a trifling idlesbee, and means now it ſeems, when you come to my own words, to go nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly over them, as of leſſer concernment than your own foreſtalled conceits, which you have hitherto made ſport with. You firſt ſet up a may pole, and then danced about it, and now at length half tired, and almoſt out of breath, you come home to me.</p>
            <p>My firſt paragraff about <hi>Diverſity of feuds</hi> you do not much except againſt. But I ſee you do not affect the <hi>ſchoolmen,</hi> haply for the ſame reaſon the French love not <hi>Talbot,</hi> having been uſed in their infancy to be frighted with that name. However you think I have good reaſon to make honourable mention of them, becaus <hi>they were,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the hammerers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Popery.</hi> Alas Sir, I ſee that anger ſpoils your memory; for in the twelfth and thirteenth chapter of that very book of your <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> you make <hi>Popery</hi> to be hammered and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not a few hundred of years, before any <hi>ſchoolmen</hi> were extant. You check me alſo for ſaying, that reformation of religion is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by emulous Plebeians, <hi>as though,</hi> ſay you, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, Joſiah, and other good Kings and Princes alſo of our own were emulous Plebeians.</hi> But Sir, when I ſay in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> p. 20. <hi>what glory the emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Plebeian ſees given to higher ſpirits,</hi> &amp;c. I only ſpeak of the times of vulgar inſurrection
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57771:18"/>againſt autority; as all men ſee except your ſelf, who will not.</p>
            <p>My ſecond paragraff of the <hi>Ground of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels</hi> you like well enough, and explicate it with a text to help me out. I could not haply tell, how to cite <hi>James,</hi> the fourth chapter, the firſt and ſecond vers of that chapter, without your help. However, it is kindnes though it be but cours, as Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> told his maid, when ſhe kiſt him as he was going to execution; and ſo I take it.</p>
            <p>My third paragraff about <hi>nullity of title,</hi> would, you think, every period of it confute my ſelf. But that ſaying of <hi>S. Paul, An à vobis verbum Dei proceſsit, an ad vos ſolos pervenit,</hi> which I make uſe of to ſtop the mouths of all vitilitigatours in religion, was <hi>cited by me,</hi> you think, <hi>in an unhappy hour; becaus,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ther is not any one ſingle text of ſcriptur more fatal to papal pretenſions.</hi> And why ſo Sir? <hi>Becaus</hi> the Goſpel you ſay, <hi>came to Rome</hi> as well as it came to us here in <hi>England.</hi> And this is all you ſay, to prove that text to be ſo fatal to papal pretenſions. To this Sir I have already told you, that it came not to us as it came to <hi>Rome:</hi> and now I tell you again, that it came to us from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to <hi>Rome</hi> from us. And therfor is that text fatal to us, not to them: It may open their mouths, but I am ſure it ſtops ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heats and reſolutions,</hi> the ſubject of my fourth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57771:19"/>paragraff, which your ſelf will not countenance, you will not permit me to diſlike. You may talk againſt them, and I may not. But I may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; for I knew not then, ſuch a man of art as your ſelf, would ſpeak of that he underſtood better then I do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>motives of moderation</hi> in my ſixt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff you laugh at; and I will not ſtop your merriment. But in all this ſay you <hi>Fiat Lux hath a ſecret deſign,</hi> which your eagle-ſighted eye has diſcovered. And <hi>in vain is the net ſpread before the eyes of a thing that hath a wing.</hi> And I muſt know, that the authour of <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> is that thing that hath a wing.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 148. <hi>to</hi> 177.</p>
            <p>Your ſixt chapter, which meets juſt with my ſixt paragraff of the <hi>Obſcurity of God,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, where you declare the ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg we have of God by divine revelation, whereunto by our humble beleef we have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed our conſent, is right and good; but not at all againſt me, who there treat a caſe of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical concernment, which you apprehend not. It is no wonder then, you ſhould ſo much diſlike all that my plea of uncertainly, not only before any teacher appear, but after too; whiles you take the teacher and his words as they walk hand in hand actually linkt together with our beleef in him; which actual beleef my ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpends and ſeparates, to the end I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57771:19"/>whether any ſuch teacher can appear ſo accompliſht as to move us, who live in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and coin religion anew, to a beleef in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable: ſo that through your too much haſte, you utterly miſtake all my whole diſcours, and ſpeak nothing at all to the caſe I treat of. I ſpeak wholly there, as in other parts of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition of the condition, the generality of people are now actually in, here in <hi>England,</hi> where every one lets himſelf looſe at pleaſure to frame opinions and religions of themſelvs. And ſo cannot be thought to ſpeak of a ſettled beleef, but only of ſettling one, or one to be ſettled; which there and elswhere in that book, I endeavour to ſhow impoſſible to be ſo fixedly ſtated by any private man, but that himſelf and others may rationally doubt it. And that therfor our only way is to beleev and not diſpute, to ſubmit to the old way we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly received, and not to ſurmiſe a new. This is the very ſubſtance, ſcope and purpos not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that paragraff, but of my whole book, which you do as utterly ſwerve from, as ever any blinded man, put to thraſh a cock, miſplaced his blow. Perhaps it is hard for you to conceiv your ſelf in a ſtate you are not actually in at preſent: And if you cannot do this, you will be abſolutely unfit to deal with ſuch hypothetik diſcourſes, as I ſee indeed you are. <hi>Bellarmins</hi> little <hi>catechiſe</hi> had been a fitter book for you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57771:20"/>to write <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon, than my <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> There is good poſitive doctrin, ſigned <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and ſpecified to your inclination and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. I meddle not with any; I deliver no poſitive doctrin at all; I never deſcend to any particular concluſion or <hi>theſis</hi> of faith; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no opinion but only this, <hi>That every opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is defenſible, and yet none impregnable.</hi> Do you not bluſh Sir, to ſee your own groſs miſtake. God is my witnes, when I finde you, miſled by your own errour, ſo furiouſly to tax me with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, fraud, blaſphemy, atheiſme, I cannot but pitty you. And generally you talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well in this chapter as others. Let me give ſom little hint of it in particular, for this once.</p>
            <p>Where I in my foreſaid paragraff ſay, that <hi>differences of faith in its branches are apt to infer a ſuſpition in its very root, and conſequently atheiſm.</hi> To this you reply, that <hi>That diſcours of mine is all rotten:</hi> that <hi>Chriſtian religion it ſelf might thus be queſtioned:</hi> that <hi>it is the argument of the Pagan Celſus:</hi> that <hi>ſuch conteſts have ever been:</hi> that <hi>Proteſtants are reſolved:</hi> that <hi>Catholiks turn atheiſts as well as others:</hi> that <hi>our religion is the ſame yeſterday and to day:</hi> that <hi>our evils are from our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Doth this talk concern or plead to my aſſertion? I know all this, as well as you; but that it is nothing to the purpos, that I know, and you it ſeems do not. Though all this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57771:20"/>you ſay be true, yet ſtill it remains notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as true and certain as it was before, and that is certain enough, That difference of faith in its branches are apt to infer a ſuſpicion in its very root; and conſequently atheiſm. You have but beaten the air.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe unto all that diſcours of mine, <hi>If the Papiſt or Roman Catholik, who firſt brought us the news of our Chriſtianity, be now becom ſo odious, then may likewiſe the whole ſtory of our Chriſtianity be at length thought a Romance.</hi> You ſpeak with the like extravagancy; and mind not my hypothetick at all, to ſpeak directly to my inference, as it became a man of art to do. But neglecting my conſequence, which in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours is principally and ſolely intended, you ſeem to deny my ſuppoſition; which, if my diſcours had been drawn into a ſyllogiſm, would have been the minor part of it. And it conſiſts of two categories; firſt, that the <hi>Papiſt is now becom odious:</hi> ſecond, that the <hi>Papiſt delivered us the firſt news of Chriſtianity.</hi> The firſt of theſe you little heed, the ſecond you deny; <hi>That the Papiſt,</hi> ſay you, <hi>or Roman Catholik firſt brought Chriſt and his Chriſtianity into this land is moſt untrue, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. And your reaſon is, becaus <hi>if any Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans came hither, they were not Papiſts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Chriſtianity came from the Eaſt, namely by Joſeph of Arimathea,</hi> &amp;c. And this is all you ſay to my hypothetick or conditional ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57771:21"/>as if I had ſaid nothing at all but that one abſolute category, which being delivered before, I now only ſuppoſe. You uſe to call me a civil logician, but I fear a natural one as you are, will hardly be able to juſtifie this motion of yours as artificial. A conditional hath a verity of its own, ſo far differing from the ſuppoſed category, that this being fals that may yet be true. For example, if I ſhould ſay thus: A man who hath wings as an eagle, or if a man had wings as an eagle, he might fly in the air, as well as another bird. Such an aſſertion is not to be confuted by proving that a man hath not the wings of an eagle. Yet ſo you deal with me here, a great maſter of arts with a civil logician. But, that I may go along with you, we had not Sir our Chriſtianity immediately from the Eaſt, nor from <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told you, we Engliſhmen had not. For as he delivered his Chriſtianity to ſom Brittons, when our land was not called <hi>England</hi> but <hi>Albion,</hi> or <hi>Brittany,</hi> and the inhabitants were not Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men but Brittons or Kimbrians, ſo likewiſe did that Chriſtianity and the whole news of it quite vaniſh, being ſodainly overwhelmed by the ancient deluge of paganiſme: nor did it ever come from them to us. Nay, the Brittons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs had ſo forgot and loſt it, that even they alſo needed a ſecond converſion, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Pope <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> And that was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57771:21"/>the onely news of Chriſtianity which prevailed and laſted even amongſt the very Brittans: which ſeems to me a great ſecret of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in planting and governing his Church; as if he would have nothing to ſtand firm and laſting, but what was immediately fixed and ſeated upon that rock. For all other converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have vaniſht, and the very ſeats of the other Apoſtles failed, that all might the better ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an unity of one head. Nay the tables which God made with his own hand were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the other framed by <hi>Moſes</hi> remained, that we might learn to give a due reſpect to him whom God hath ſet over us as our head and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler under him, and none exalt himſelf againſt him. I know you will laugh at this my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I cannot but tell you what I think. To return then to my former diſcours; when I ſpeak good Sir, of the news of Chriſtianity firſt brought to this land, I mean not that which was firſt brought upon the earth or ſoil of this land, and ſpoken to any body then dwelling here; but which was delivered to the fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the now preſent inhabitants, who be Saxes or Engliſhmen. And I ſay that we, the now preſent inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> off-ſpring of the Engliſh or Saxons, had the firſt news of our Chriſtianity immediately from <hi>Rome,</hi> and from Pope <hi>Gregorius</hi> the Roman Patriarch, by the hands of his miſſioner St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57771:22"/>all men know to be as true, as they know that Papiſts are now becom odious. Sith then the categorick aſſertions are both clear; namely, that the Papiſt firſt brought us the news of Chriſtianity; and ſecondly, that the Papiſt is now becom odious amongſt us; what ſay you to my conſequence? that the whole ſtory of Chriſtianity may as well be deemed a Romance, as any part of that Chriſtianity we at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as now judged to be part of a Romance. This conſequence of mine it behoved a man of thoſe great parts you would be thought to have, to heed attentively; and yet you never mind it.</p>
            <p>You adde in the cloſe of your diſcours, that <hi>many things delivered us at firſt with the firſt news of Chriſtianity may be afterwards rejected for the love of Chriſt, and by the commiſsion of Chriſt?</hi> But Sir, what love of Chriſt dictates, what commiſſion of Chriſt allows you, to choos and reject at your own pleaſure? what heretick was ever ſo much a fool, as not to pretend the love of Chriſt, and commiſſion of Chriſt for what he did? How ſhall any one know you do it, out of any ſuch either love or commiſſion? ſith thoſe who delivered the articles of faith now rejected, pretended equal love of Chriſt and commiſſion of Chriſt, for the delivery of them, as of any other. And why may we not at length reject all the reſt, for love of ſomething els?
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57771:22"/>when this love of Chriſt, which is now crept out into the very outſide of our lips, is ſlipt off thence. Do you think men cannot finde a cavil againſt him, as well as his law delivered unto us with the firſt news of him? and as eaſily dig up the root, as cut up the branches? Is not the thing already don, and many becom atheiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account? Pray ſpeak to me ſomthing of reaſon. Did not the Jews by pretens of their love to that immortal God, whom their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſerved, reject the whole Goſpel at once? and why may not we poſſibly as well do it by peece-meals! Let us leav cavils: Grant my ſuppoſition which you know you cannot deny: then ſpeak to my conſequence, which I deem moſt ſtrong and good, to infer a concluſion which neither you nor I can grant. I tell you plainly and without tergiverſation, before God and all his holy angels, what I ſhould think, if I deſcended unto any concluſion in this affair. And it is this: either the Papiſt, who holds at this day all thoſe articles of faith which were delivered at the firſt converſion of this land by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is unjuſtly becom odious amongſt us; or els my honeſt Parſons throw off your caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocks, and reſign your benefices and glebe-lands into the hands of your neighbours, whoſe they were aforetime: my conſequence is irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable.</p>
            <p>If any part, much more if many parts, great
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57771:23"/>ſubſtantial parts of religion brought into the land with the firſt news of Chriſtianity, be once rejected (as they are now amongſt us) as Romiſh or Romancical, and that rejection or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be permitted, then may other parts and all parts, if the gap be not ſtopt, be lookt upon at length as points of no better a condition. Nay it muſt needs be ſo: for the ſame way and means that lopt off ſom branches, will do the like to others, and root too: A villification of that Church, wherein they find themſelvs, who have a minde to prevaricate, upon pretens of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur and power of interpreting, light, ſpirit, or reaſon, adjoyned with a perſonal obſtinacy that will not ſubmit, will do it roundly and to effect. This firſt brought off the Proteſtants from the Roman catholik Church; this lately ſeparated the Presbyterian from the Engliſh Proteſtant Church, the Independent from the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Quaker from other Independents. And this laſt good man heeds nothing of Chriſtian religion but only the moral part, which in deed and truth is but honeſt paganiſme. This ſpeech is worthy of all ſerious conſideration. And I could wiſh you would ponder it ſeriouſly. See if the <hi>Quaker</hi> deny not as reſolutely the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating power of baptiſm, as you the efficacy of abſolution. See if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> do not with as much reaſon evacuate the prelacy of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as they the Papacy. See if the <hi>Socinian</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57771:23"/>arguments againſt the Trinity, be not as ſtrong as yours againſt the real preſence in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. See if the <hi>Jew</hi> do not with as much plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility deride Chriſt, as you his Church. See if <hi>Porphiry, Julian,</hi> and other ancient pagans, do not as ſtrongly confute all Chriſtianity, as we any part of it. He is a fool, that having a will and power enough, cannot find out as plauſible a pretence for the pulling down of Churches, as we had any for the deſtroying of Monaſteries. Ther be books lately ſet forth, and by more then one authour here in this land, which do as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully diſſipate the conceit we once had of hell, as any ever did elude Purgatory. Did we not lately find out texts and reaſonings againſt our King and monarchy, as many as we found out long ago againſt Pope and popery? Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and our ſouls immortality if any liſt to deny, he may have more abundant argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions every where occurring, than any other piece of popery now rejected ever felt. If one text of ſcriptur be by a trope of rhetorick made to ſpeak a ſens, contrarty to what was beleeved in catholik times in any one point, cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other text by ſome ſuch ſlight be forced to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate another. I am ſure it may do ſo, and has done ſo. And thus when all articles are at laſt by ſuch tricks of wit caſhiered, can there be wanting ſeveral appearing incongruities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, tautologies, improbabilities, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57771:24"/>all holy writ at once. And cannot the Jew afford us at laſt arguments enough, to diſſipate at length the very name of Chriſt out of the world, which after the whole extirpation of his law, will but float on mens lips like an empty ſhadow, till it quite vaniſh. Theſe things Sir, are not only true, but clear and evident. And nothing is wanting to juſtifie them, but a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration.</p>
            <p>Theſe few words Sir, which I have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you by way of ſupererogation, above what I needed, will ſomwhat inlighten you to diſcern the goodnes and neceſſity of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. <hi>If the Papiſt who firſt brought us the news of Chriſtianity be now becom odious, then may all Chriſtianity at length be thought a Romance,</hi> &amp;c. Religion like a hous, if a breach be once made and not repaired to former unity, will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all moulder away, till no one room be left intire.</p>

            <p>Your ſeventh chapter finiſhed in five leafs, runs, or flies over two or three of my paragraffs at once, which make up above fifty pages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obſcurity of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> All which diſcours of mine is, you ſay, <hi>nothing to my purpos,</hi> but foiſted in for <hi>a blinde to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my readers.</hi> But Sir, thoſe judicious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders you lately left behind you, who diſcern my purpos better than I ſee you do, will tell you,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57771:24"/>that it is ſo much to my purpos, that nothing could be more. At leaſt you let all paſs without either cenſure or commendation, till you meet happily at length with a word or two of mine (let fall in my ninth paragraff called <hi>Help</hi>) about <hi>ſcripture.</hi> This makes your heart leap; it is a common place you know how to ſport in, and you never meet with that ſound, but it makes you dance. Your chapter then, which is written againſt all my philoſophical diſcours of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> is called <hi>ſcripture vindicated,</hi> as though I had induſtriouſly wrote againſt ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And therin you ſweetly dilate upon the excellency and goodnes of the word of God, as if I had any way diminiſhed it, or wrote againſt it; juſt according to the tone of our late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal times, <hi>Lord, I am for thy caus Lord, I am left alone to plead thy caus Lord againſt thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> But Sir, the few words I there ſpeak, only incidentally, in the end of that my paragraff called <hi>Help,</hi> concerning the ſurmiſes that men have about ſcriptur, as they be but a ſmall part of the many, which I know to be now vented up and down the land in this our preſent ſtate of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one from another; ſo if I had not given ſom touch of them in that metaphyſick abſtracted diſcours of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which proceeds, as I have ſaid upon a ſuppoſition of our chuſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king religions here in <hi>England</hi> at pleaſur, unto endles differences and diviſions, it had been a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57771:25"/>maimed and imperfect work, and no wayes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory unto thoſe judicious readers unto whom I write, though you do not. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tell you, what ſoever you think of your ſelf, you are in truth, except you diſſemble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake on purpos, but a weak man, to take that as ſpoken abſolutely by me, and by way of poſitive doctrin, which I only deliver upon an <hi>hypotheſis</hi> apparent to all the world beſides your ſelf. You would make a mad commentatour upon <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Eccleſiaſtes.</hi> I ſpeak upon a ſuppoſition of doubting, which theſe times have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, of interpreting, accepting, rejecting, framing, forging religions and opinions to our ſelves; and you reply againſt me words and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes that preſuppoſe an aſſent of beleeving. If a man beleev, he cannot doubt. And if he doubt not of the ſcriptures truth, he cannot make exceptions againſt any of its properties. But if any begin to queſtion this or that, or other part of doctrin contained in ſcriptur, and delivered by thoſe who firſt brought it, as every one does who ſwerves from the Church he found himſelf in; then I ſuppoſe ſuch a one doubts. And being now thereby ſeparated from that body of beleevers to which he before by faith adhered, he cannot now left to himſelf, but proceed, if he give attendance to the conduct of his own ſurmiſing thoughts, to more ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then I was willing to expreſs.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57771:25"/>
            <p> But Sir, what you ſay here, and ſo often up and down your book, of Papiſts contempt of ſcriptur, I beſeech you will pleaſe to abſtain from it for the time to com: I have converſed with the Roman catholiks of <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> I have read more of their books, both hiſtories, contemplatives, and ſcholaſtick divines, than I beleev you have ever ſeen or heard of. I have ſeen the devotion both of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, colledges of ſacred prieſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houſes, I have communed with all ſorts of people, and peruſed their councels. And after all this, I tell you, and out of my love I tell you, that their reſpect to ſcriptur is real, abſolute and cordial even to admiration. Others may talk of it, but they act it, and would be ready to ſtone that man that ſhould diminiſh holy writ. Let us not wrong the innocent. The ſcriptur is theirs, and Jeſus Chriſt is theirs, who alſo will plead their caus when he ſees time.</p>

            <p>In your eight chapter, which falls upon my paragraff of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> you are abſolutely in a wood, and wonder more then ordinary, how <hi>that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of mine, concerning reaſon to be excluded from the imploiment of fraeming articles of religion, can any wayes concern</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>or be a confutation of</hi> Proteſtants. As though <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to any ſuch concernment againſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Your head is ſo full, it ſeems of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57771:26"/>faculty for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that if <hi>Popery</hi> be but mentioned in a book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an epithet of deteſtation, you conclude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that the book is written for Popery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Proteſtants. And if every thing therin contained, anſwer not the idea of your brain, then it is impertinent with you, it is ſilly, it is beſides the purpos. And this cenſur you have given, ſtill as you have gone along all my whole book hitherto, of every part and parcel of it, even from my preface to this preſent paragraff of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> You cannot ſee how all that vain flouriſhing diſcours of mine, concerning diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of feuds, ground of quarrels, nullity of title, heats and reſolution, motives to moderation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of God, natur and providence, or the like, <hi>ſhould confute Proteſtancy, or any way concern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. And therfor it is wholly impertinent.</hi> Thus the famous Knight, when he had once conceived an idea of his own errantry, every flock of ſheep muſt be an army and every wind-mill a giant, or els it is impertinent to <hi>Don Quixot.</hi>

            <p>Your ninth chapter upon my paragraff of <hi>Light and Spirit;</hi> is wholly ſpent, neglecting all my other diſcours, in ſolving <hi>the Jewiſh objection,</hi> which I anſwer my ſelf. And if you have added any thing better than mine, I ſhall be thankful for it as ſoon as I ſee it. But I fear your vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flouriſhes about ſcriptur which you love to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57771:26"/>talk on, will not without the help of your <hi>Credo</hi> and humble reſignation, ſolve the argument; which that you may the eaſſier be quit of, you never examin; but only run on in your uſual flouriſhes about the <hi>uſe and excellency</hi> of <hi>Gods word.</hi> I told you in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> what the Jew will reply to all ſuch reaſonings, but you have the pregnant wit not to heed any thing that may hinder your flouriſhes. But Sir, if you were kept up in a chamber with a learned Jew, without bread water and fire, till you had ſatisfied him in that objection; I am ſtill well enough aſſured, for all your aery vaunts, that if you do not make uſe of your <hi>Credo,</hi> which here you contemn, you might there ſtay till hunger and cold had made an end of you. But I beleev you love not ſuch dry blows; however you may be delighted with pen encounters at a diſtance, where after your <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> has been well inſpired with the warm ſpirits blown hither out of the fortunate iſlands, you may cavil revile and threaten at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and knock down the ſhadow of your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary which your own ſpirits have raiſed up, and preſented to you in your chamber.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 213 <hi>to</hi> 228.</p>
            <p>Your tenth chapter runs over two of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraffs, which ſpeak the plea of <hi>Independents, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> That you eſteem idle, the other ſenſles, the laſt inſufficient. And to make this laſt good, you endeavour to diſable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57771:27"/>both what I have ſet down to make againſt the Prelate Proteſtant, and alſo what I have ſaid for him. I ſaid in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> that it made not a little againſt our Proteſtants, that after the prelate Proteſtancy was ſettled in <hi>England,</hi> they were forced for their own preſervation againſt Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, to take up ſom of thoſe principles again, which former Proteſtants had saſt down for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, as is the <hi>autority</hi> of a viſible Church, efficacy of <hi>ordination,</hi> difference between <hi>clergy</hi> and <hi>laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. Here firſt you deny <hi>that thoſe principles are popiſh.</hi> But Sir, ther be ſom Jews even at this day, who will deny any ſuch man as <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> to have ever been in <hi>Jury.</hi> I have other things to do, than to fill volums with uſeles texts, which here I might eaſily do, out of the books both of the firſt reformers, and catholik divines and councels. Then ſecondly you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge me <hi>to prove, that thoſe principles were ever dented by our prelate Proteſtants.</hi> And this you do wittily and like your ſelf. You therfor bid me prove that thoſe principles were ever denied by our prelate Proteſtants, becaus I ſay, that our prelate Proteſtants here in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as they became ſuch, took up again thoſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med principles, which Proteſtants their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both here in <hi>England</hi> and beyond the ſeas, before our prelacy was ſet up, had ſtill rejected. When I ſay then, that out prelate Proteſtant affirmed and aſſerted thoſe principles which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57771:27"/>Proteſtants denied; you bid me prove that our prelate Proteſtant ever denied them.</p>
            <p>Thus you contradict what I ſay is pleaded againſt our prelate Proteſtant. And again you do as ſtiffly gain-ſay what I plead for him my ſelf. You laugh at me even with head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and tell me, <hi>that the prelate-Proteſtant has far better arguments for themſelvs, then either mine is, or any I can bring; nor do they need the help of ſuch a weak logician as my ſelf, in this their caus.</hi> Sir give me leav to tell you here once for all, that I thought it ſufficient for my deſign, to ſet down either for Papiſt or Proteſtant, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required, ſuch reaſons as appeared plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my ſelf; and to ſay all for them that can be ſaid, was neither the work of my ſmall ability, nor any purpos of my deſign. And it is enough to me, that I know no better. But let us ſee what my argument is, and how you cruſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Church,</hi> ſay I, <hi>muſt have a byſhop, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe will not have ſuch a viſible head, as ſhe had at firſt,</hi> &amp;c. This that you may evacuate, you tell me, that <hi>the Church hath ſtill the ſame head ſhe had, which is Chriſt, who is preſent with his Church by his Spirit and laws, and is man-God ſtill as much as ever he was, and ever the ſame will be: and if I would have any other viſible biſhop to be that head, then it ſeems I would not have the ſame head, and ſo would have the ſame and yet not the ſame.</hi> Thus you ſpeak.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57771:28"/>
            <p> But Sir, I cannot in any reaſon be thought to ſpeak otherwiſe, if we would uſe true logick, of the identity of the head, than I do of the identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body of the Church. This body is not numerically the ſame: for the men of the firſt age are long ago gone out of the world, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other generation com, who yet are a body of Chriſtians of the ſame kind; becaus they adhere to the ſame principles of faith. And as the body is of the ſame kind, though not numerically the ſame; ſo do I require, that ſince Jeſus Chriſt as man, the head immediate of other beleeving men, is departed hence to the glory of his Father, that the Church ſhould ſtill have a head of the ſame kind, as viſibly now preſent, as ſhe had in the beginning; or els ſay I, ſhe cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely the ſame body, or a body of the ſame kind ſhe was. But this ſhe hath not, this ſhe is not, except ſhe have a viſible byſhop, as ſhe had in the beginning, preſent with her, guiding and ruling under God. Chriſt our Lord is indeed ſtill man-God, but this man-hood is now ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; nor is he viſibly now preſent as man, which immediately headed his beleevers under God, on whoſe influence that natur depended. His God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is ſtill the ſame in all things, not only in it ſelf, but in order alſo to his Church, as it was before, equally inviſible, and in the like manner beleeved; but the natur delegate under God, and once ruling viſibly amongſt us by words and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57771:28"/>examples, is now utterly withdrawn. And if a natur of the ſame kind, be not now delegate with a power of exteriour government, as at the firſt ther was, then hath not the Church the ſame head now, which ſhe had then, nor is ſhe the ſame polity or body ſhe was before: <hi>Qui habet aures audiendi audiat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way we may take notice what a ſincere Engliſh Proteſtant you are, who labour ſo ſtoutly to evacuate my argument for epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and leav none of your own behind you, nor acquaint the world with any, although <hi>you know far better;</hi> but would make us beleev not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe far better reaſons for prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that Chriſt himſelf, as he is the immediate and only head of the inviſible influence, ſo is he likewiſe the only and immediate head of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble direction and government among us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interpoſition of any perſon delegate in his ſtead, to overſee and rule under him in his Church on earth: which is againſt the tenour both of ſacred goſpel, and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> epiſtles, and all antiquity, and the preſent eccleſiaſtick po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>England;</hi> and is the doctrin not of any Engliſh Proteſtant, but of the Presbyterian, Independent, and Quaker.</p>
            <p>Chriſt then in your way is immediate head not only of ſubminiſtration and influence, but of exterior direction and government to his Church. Pray tell me, is he ſuch an immediate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57771:29"/>head to all beleevers, or no? if he be to all, then is no man to be governed in affairs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by any other man; and Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are as needleſs, as either Catholik or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant byſhops. On the other ſide, if he be not immediate head to all, but miniſters head the people, and Chriſt heads the miniſters, this in effect is nothing els, but to make every miniſter a byſhop. Why do you not plainly ſay, what it is more than manifeſt you would have. All this while you heed no more the laws of the land, than conſtitutions of goſpel.</p>
            <p>As for goſpel; That Lord, who had been viſible governour and paſtour of his flock on earth, when he was now to depart hence, as all the apoſtles expected one to be choſen to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in his care, ſo did he, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own inviſible preſence and providence over his flock, publikly appoint one. And when he taught them, that he who were greateſt among them ſhould be as the leaſt, he did not deny but ſuppoſe one greater, and taught in one and the ſame breath, both that he was over them, and for what he was over them, namely to feed, not to tyrannize, not to domineer, abuſe, and hurt, but to direct, comfort, and conduct his flock, in all humility and tendernes, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of all their ſpiritual neceſſities. And if a byſhop be otherwiſe affected, it is the fault of his perſon, not his place.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57771:29"/>
            <p> As for the laws of the land, it is there moſt ſtrongly decreed by the conſent and autority of the whole Kingdom, not only that byſhops are over miniſters, but that the Kings majeſty is head of byſhops alſo in the line of hierarchy, from whoſe hand they receiv both their place and juriſdiction. This was eſtabliſht not onely by one, but ſeveral acts and conſtitutions, both in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> So that by the laws of the land ther be two greeces between miniſters and Chriſt; which you cut off, to the end you may ſecretly uſurp the autority and place of both, to the overthrow at once both of goſpel and our law too.</p>
            <p>By the laws of our land our ſeries of eccleſiaſtical government ſtands thus.

            <p>So that the Miniſters head in the Presbyterian predicament, touches Chriſts feet immediately, and nothing intervenes. You pretend indeed, that hereby you do exalt Chriſt; but this is a meer cheat, as all men may ſee with their eyes; for Chriſt is but where he was; but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter indeed is exalted, being now ſet in the Kings place, one degree higher than the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who by the law is under both King and byſhop too.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57771:30"/>
            <p> You will here ſay to me, <hi>What is the Papiſts line of Church government. There the Pope muſt ſit next Chriſt, and Kings under his feet.</hi> Sir, I have not time in this ſhort letter to diſcours this ſubject as it deſerves. Nor does it now concern me, who have no more here to ſay than only this; that my argument for prelacy, howſoever in your words you may diſable it, is not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you in deeds at all, and as far as I can perceiv, not underſtood. Yet two things I ſhall tell you over and above what I need in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair alſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt is, that Roman catholiks do more truly and cordially acknowledg the reſpective Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King of any Kingdom to be ſupream head of his catholik ſubjects even in affairs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than any other, whether Independents, Presbyterians, or even prelate Proteſtants have, if we ſpeak of truth and reality, ever done. And this I could eaſily make good both by the laws and practiſes of all catholik kingdoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth in any age on one ſide, and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite practiſes of all Proteſtants on the other. Second is, that for what reaſons Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks deny a prince to be head of the Church, for the ſame ought all others as they deny it in deeds, ſo, if they would ſpeak ſincerely as they think and act, to deny it in words alſo as well as they. For catholiks do beleev him to be head of the Church, from whom the channel of religion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57771:30"/>and all direction in it is derived and flows; for which reaſon a ſpring is ſaid to be head of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But neither does any King upon earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be prieſt and prophet too, ever trouble himſelf to derive religion, as the Pope has ever don: neither does either Proteſtant, Presbyterian or Independent, either in <hi>England</hi> or elswhere, ever ſeek for religion from the lips of the king, or ſupplicate unto him when any doubt ariſes in thoſe affairs, as they ought in conſcience and honeſty to do, for a final deciſion, any more than the Roman catholik does. So that whatever any of them may ſay, all Proteſtants do as much deny the thing in their behaviour, as catholiks do in words; and catholiks do in their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our obſerv as much, as Proteſtants either pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe or pretend. What is the reaſon that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholiks in all occurring difficulties of faith, both have their recours unto their papal Paſtour, (unto whom Kings themſelvs remit them) and acquieſce alſo to his deciſion and judgment, but only becaus they beleev him to be head of the Church. And if Proteſtants have no ſuch recours, nor will not acquieſce to his Majeſties autority in affairs of religion, but proceed to wars and quarrels without end, the prince neglected as wholly unconcerned in thoſe reſolvs, they do as manifeſtly deny his headſhip, as if they profeſt none. Nay, to acknowledg a headſhip in words, and deny it in deeds, is but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57771:31"/>mockery. By theſe two words Sir, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Kings majeſty is as much head of the Church to Roman Catholiks as to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and theſe no more than they either derive religion or deciſion of their doubts from the kings chair,</p>
            <p>Ith interim it is a ſhame and general ſcandal to the whole world, that we in <hi>England</hi> ſhould neither ſupplicate nor acquieſce in affairs of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to his Majeſties judgment, whom in words we acknowledg head of the Church, but fight and quarrel without end; and yet have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to upbraid Roman catholiks with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary beleef, who although they ever looked upon their papal patriarch as ſpiritual head and paſtour and deriver of their faith, unto whom they ſo ſubmit, that he who after his deciſion remains contumacious forfeits his Chriſtianity, yet have they notwithſtanding in all ages and kingdoms reſigned with a moſt ready cordial reverence unto all deciſions, orders and acts of their temporal princes even in ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical affairs, as well as civil, ſo far as their laws reached, as ſupreme head and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their reſpective kingdoms. And all kings and princes find in a very ſhort ſpace, however others may utter hypocritical words of flattery, that indeed none but catholik ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do heed and fear and obſerv them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, in all whatever their commands, being
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57771:31"/>taught by their religion, of which they alone give account at times appointed for penance, to hearken and obey for conſcience ſake all higher powers, conſtituted over them for good.</p>
            <p>That catholiks do univerſally obſerv their King in all affairs as well eccleſiaſtick as civil, I need not, to make it good, ſend you Sir either to the teſtimonies of civil law and <hi>Codex</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> or the other various conſtitutions of ſo many ſeveral provinces and kingdoms, as are and have been in Chriſtendom, our own home will ſuffice to juſtifie it. Were not the ſpiritual courts, both court Chriſtian, Prerogative court and Chancery, all ſet up in catholik times, about matters of religion, and affairs of conſcience, and all mannaged by clerks or clergy-men under the King? In brief, where ever any civil coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or coactive power intervenes, be it in what affair it will, all ſuch power and action who ever uſes it, hath it autoritatively only from the King. For neither Pope, nor Byſhop, nor any Prieſt ought to be a ſtriker, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches: nor have they any lands, or livings, or court, or power to compel or puniſh either in goods or body, but what is lent or given by princes and princely men, out of their love and reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt and his holy goſpel, whoſe news they firſt conveighed about the world; although a juſt donation is, I ſhould think, as good a title,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57771:32"/>as either emption, inheritance, or conqueſt, if it be irrevocable. The King is the only ſtriker in the land <hi>ex jure,</hi> and the ſword of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is only in his hand; and none can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or puniſh either in body or goods, but only himſelf, or others by his commiſſion, in any whatever affair. He can either by his authority and laws blunt the ſword of thoſe who have one in their hand, whether by pact or nature, as have maſters over ſervants, and parents over chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or put a civil power into the hands of thoſe who otherwiſe have none, as prelates, prieſts, and byſhops. So that although the Pope derive religion, and chiefly direct in it, yet is the King the only head of all civil coercition, as well in Church affairs as any other, which his commands and laws do reach unto.</p>
            <p>So that the line of Church government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt catholiks, ſince the converſion of kings, runs in two ſtreams; the one is of direction, the other of coercition. That of direction is from Chriſt to the chief paſtour, from him to patriarchs, then to metropolitans, arch-byſhops, byſhops, prieſts, and people: and in this line is no corporal coaction at all, except it be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; nor any other power to puniſh, but only by debarring men from ſacraments. In the other line of corporal power and autority the King is immediately under God the Almighty, from whom he receivs the ſword to keep and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57771:32"/>defend the dictates of truth and juſtice, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream governour, though himſelf for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith be ſubject to the Church from whoſe hands he received it, as well as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his ſubjects; after the King ſucceed his princes and governours in order, with that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power all of them, which they have from him their leige ſovereign received. This in brief of papal Church government, which we in <hi>England</hi> by our canting talk of the Lord Chriſt, to the end we may be all lords and all Chriſts, have utterly ſubverted.</p>
            <p>Indeed in primitive times the channel of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for three hundred years ran apart, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from civil government which in thoſe dayes perſecuted it. And then the line of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian government was unmixt. None but prieſts guided, defended, governed the Church and Chriſtian flock; which they did by the power of their faith, vertue, ſecret ſtrength, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in Jeſus their Lord inviſible. Afterward it pleaſed the God of mercies, to move the hearts of emperours and kings of the earth, to ſubmit unto a participation of grace; which they were more eaſily inclined by the innocence and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian faith, eſpecially in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of peaceful obedience unto kings and rulers, though aliens, and pagans, and perſecutors of religion. And now kings being made Chriſtian were looked upon by their ſubjects with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57771:33"/>reverence, more loved, more feared, more honoured than before. Nor could Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now tell, how to expres that ineffable reſpect they bore their Kings, now co-heirs of heaven, with them, whom before in their very paganiſm they were taught by their prieſts to obſerv as gods upon earth, not for wrath only or fear of puniſhment, but for conſcience alſo, and danger of hazarding not only their temporal contents, but their eternal ſalvation alſo, for their reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing autority though reſident in pagans. And Kings on the other ſide, who aforetime by the counſel of worldly ſenatours enacted laws, ſuch as they thought fit for preſent policy, and defended them by the ſword of juſtice, wielden under God to the terrour of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and defence of the innocent, began now, as was incumbent on their duty, to uſe that ſword for the protection of Chriſtianity, and faith, and the better way now chalked out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by Chriſtian prieſts, from Jeſus the wiſdom and Son of God. And by the direction of the ſame holy prelates, abbots, and other prieſts, who were now admitted with other ſenators into counſel, did they in all places en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſpeciall and particular laws anſwerable to the genetal rule of faith, which they found to be more excellent and perfect, than any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had by natural reaſon hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57771:33"/>
            <p> Thus poor Chriſtians, who had hitherto but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a head of <hi>derivation,</hi> of counſel and direction, which could but only bid them have patience for Chriſts ſake, and conform themſelvs to his meek paſſion, when they ſuffered from aliens, and when they ſuffered injury from one another, could only debar the evil doer, if he gave not ſatisfaction, from further uſe of ſacraments; thoſe Chriſtians I ſay, who could hitherto have no other comfort or aſſiſtance in this world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſpiritual paſtour, than what words of piety could afford, had now by the grace of heaven princely protectours, royal defenders, and head champions under God, to vindicate and make good all Chriſtian rights, diſcipline. and truths now accepted and eſtabliſhed from faith, as well as other civil rites and cuſtoms dictated aforetime from meer reaſon, equally revengers upon all evil doers indifferently, that were found criminal in affairs, as well purely Chriſtian as civil, ſtill uſing the advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their prelates and Chriſtian peers in the framing and eſtabliſhing of all thoſe laws they were now reſolved to maintain. So it was don in <hi>England;</hi> ſo in all places of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. And then the line of Chriſtian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ran mixt, which before was ſingle. And Chriſtians now had a <hi>Joſhua</hi> to their <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> who were only led by <hi>Moyſes</hi> before. And although <hi>Aaron</hi> was head of the Church, yet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57771:34"/>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> was head and leader, prince and captain of all thoſe people who were of that Church. The chief byſhop is an <hi>Aaron,</hi> and every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian king a <hi>Joſhua.</hi> And as it is a content and ſupport to <hi>Aaron</hi> to have a <hi>Joſhua</hi> with him, to fight Gods battles, and keep the people in awe; ſo is it not a little comfort to <hi>Joſhua</hi> to have an <hi>Aaron</hi> by him, with whom he may conſult. And indeed no kingdom can have a perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment without the preſence of theſe two ſwords, civil and ſpiritual. <hi>Ecce duo gladij hic! ſatis eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although Chriſtians even at this day, when any hereſy or novelty ariſes, have ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours unto the ſame head of their religion for a deciſion of the doubt, whom they conſulted before, (for as the channel of Chriſtianity is and muſt be ſtill the ſame, ſo muſt the ſpring-head be the ſame alſo) yet when the thing is once deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they have none but kings and governours under him, to ſee the direction executed, as the only overſeers with coactive power to do it.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee in brief how the Pope is head of the Church, and the King head likewiſe, and both immediately under God; but with this difference, that the king only governs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity eſtabliſhed in his own royalty by law; the Pope without further law rules and guides all the ſtreams and rivulets of religion, where ever it flows. He is head of primary direction; the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57771:34"/>king of ſovereign execution: he of guidance and ſpiritual autority only; the king of civil and natural power inveſted in his place and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from God above, to maintain any laws as well purely Chriſtian as civil, which himſelf ſhall accept, eſtabliſh, and promulgate. The Pope perſwades; but the King commands: and although the Pope ſhould formally command, yet vertually and in effect ſuch a command amounts only to a perſwaſion; and he that obeys not, feels no ſmart for it, except the king be pleaſed to eſpous his caus, and puniſh the contumacious; which if he juſtly do, then have kings a juſt autority in thoſe affairs; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then hath the Pope no means of help or defence in this world, any more after the converſion of kings than before it; and help himſelf he cannot any other way, than only by putting people out of his communion, who care not for it. The Pope is obeyed for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and love only to his religion; the King for wrath and conſcience too: the Pope deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the rule but in general only, and blunt on one ſide; the King particulariſes it, and gives it an edg: the Popes headſhip is exerciſed in <hi>Ought</hi> and <hi>Should be;</hi> the Kings is <hi>Will and ſhall be:</hi> the Pope directs, but the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells: the Pope ſecludes the contumacious from heaven, which he that beleevs not feels not; the King over and above that, cuts off malefactors
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57771:35"/>from the face of the earth too, and they ſhall be made by feeling to beleev it.</p>
            <p>And theſe two defend and ſecure one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and keep both Chriſtians and their faith inviolate. And while Chriſtians themſelvs do both tenderly love their Pape and chief paſtour, and ſpring-head of their religion, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved beyond him to flow inviſibly from God the great ocean of truth; and withall do honor fear, and obſerv their King and princely gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who only bears the ſword of juſtice, and not in vain, to take revenge upon all thoſe, whom the love of religion and ſpiritual ſword of their paſtour will not keep in awe, they do their duty as they ought, and ſhall finde happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therein. I muſt make haſte, and can ſay no more at preſent to this buſines, which as I have told you is ſomewhat beſides my purpos.</p>
            <p>Only one thing I muſt needs tell you before I paſs on. Although a King is in a good and proper ſence ſtiled head as well of Church as State within his own dominions, as for all coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power therein; yet head of the Church <hi>abſolutely,</hi> or head of primary direction in faith, is ſo proper to the chief Prelate, that no man upon earth beſides himſelf hath ever ſo much as pretended to it: and that for five reaſons. Firſt, becaus <hi>head of the Church abſolutely,</hi> intimates an univerſal right over the guidance of religion, not in one kingdom only, but all, where ever
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57771:35"/>that religion is. And the King of <hi>France,</hi> for example, neither did nor can pretend to be head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Spain, Africk, Italy, Greece, Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. Yet ſuch a head there muſt needs be, to the end the Church may be one myſtick body, at unity in it ſelf. And that head muſt be unlimited to time and place, as the Church it ſelf is ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and univerſally ſpread; nor muſt the government alter, as governments of particular kingdoms do. Secondly, head of the Church abſolutely, involves a primacy both of conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interpreting faith: and all princes in <hi>Europe</hi> received their faith at firſt from prieſts, who ſent for that end from their ſpiritual ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our converted their kingdoms; but they never gave faith either to them or their paſtour, Thirdly, he that is head of the Church abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, muſt be of the ſame connatural conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the whole hierarchy, to confirm, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ordain, preach, attone the almighty by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, impoſe hands, ſegregate men from their worldly ſtate unto his own ſpiritual one, and in a ſpecial manner to exerciſe thoſe prieſtly functions, unto which he ſegregates them. Fourthly, head of the Church abſolutely is to be indifferent unto kingdoms and all ſorts of government, as the religion alſo is, and keep it like it ſelf in all places unaltered in its nature, however in its general dictates it may concur to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57771:36"/>the direction and good of all people and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. And therefor he cannot be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one place or government, but muſt be as it were ſeparate and in a condition indifferent to all; as a general by ſhop, whoſe ſole care is to heed thoſe eradiations of faith ſpread up and down the world, may be and is; when princes heed but their own particular kingdoms, and care not how religion goes in another, any more then their wealth or polity. Thus the ſun-beams, though they fall upon ſeveral ſoils diverſly affected, yet they keep their own nature unaltered, by vertue of one general fountain-head of light which is indifferent to every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and diſpenſes, diſtributes, and keeps the raies unchanged. The ends and wayes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are quite of another nature from all worldly buſineſſes, and therfor require a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſuperintendent ſet apart for them; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ever have had ſince the time of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions firſt maſter, who as he did educate his in order to a life eternal in a government apart, being himſelf a man diſtinct from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo uſed he to ſpeak of religious duties as ſeparate and differing from others; <hi>Reddite,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quae Caeſaris ſunt, Caeſari, &amp; quae Dei, Deo.</hi> In very truth, the Church and Chriſtianity, as it is a thing accidental to all worldly ſtates, ſo is it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced upon them as an influence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rank and order, unto a particular end of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57771:36"/>future bliſs; whereas all ſtates do of themſelves aim no further then the peace and happines of this life. And ſo for the particular end and means anſwerable therunto, which religion uſes, it will require a particular and ſpecial overſeer. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though he conceited the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al orbs to be contiguous, and ſo all rapt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a motion from Eaſt to Weſt, yet becaus they had ſpecial motions of their own, he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for allowed them particular intelligences to guide thoſe motions. So we ſee in ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, a man that hath ſeveral wayes and ends is guided by ſeveral directours, in this by a lawyer, in that by a phyſician, by a gardener, by a tradeſman, &amp;c Fiftly, becaus head of the Church abſolutely muſt be one that ſucceeds in his chair, whom Jeſus the maſter left and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed perſonally to feed his flock. No King upon earth ever pretended to fit in that Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans chair, or to ſucceed him in it, which the Pope to my knowledg for ſixteen hundred years hath both challenged as his right, and actually poſſeſt. And Catholiks are all ſo fixt in this judgment, that they can no more disbeleev it, then they can ceas to beleev in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Your eleventh chapter falls directly upon my fifteenth paragraff of Scriptur. And therfor I may here expect, you ſhould inſult over me to the purpos. But Sir I told you before, and now
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57771:37"/>tell you again, that I know no other rule to Chriſtians either for faith or manners, no other hope, no other comfort, but what ſcriptur and holy goſpel affords. But this is not any part of the debate now in hand, however you would perſwade the world to think ſo. When four or five men Sir of ſeveral judgements collected from the very ſcriptur you and I talk of, riſe up one againſt another with one and the ſame ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptur in their hands, with ſuch equal pretence of light, power, and reaſon, that no one will either yield to another, or remain himſelf in the ſame faith, but run endles diviſions without controul: does ſcriptur prevent this evil? does it, has it, can it remedy it? can any one man make a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the autority of ſcriptur alone, which neither himſelf nor any other, upon the ſame grounds he framed it, ſhall rationally doubt of. This is our caſe Sir, and only this; which you do not ſo much as take notice of, to the end you may with a more plauſible rhetorick, inſult over me as a contemner of Gods word. Nor do you heed any particle of my diſcours in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff, but according to your manner, collect principles to the number of ſeven, out of it, you ſay, which I do not know to be ſo much as hinted in it; that as you did before, ſo you may now again play with your own bawble, and confute your ſelf. And they are in a manner the very ſame you ſported with before in your
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57771:37"/>ſecond chapter. 1. <hi>from the Romans we received the goſpel.</hi> 2. <hi>what is ſpoken in ſcripture of the Church, belongs to the Roman.</hi> 3. <hi>the Roman every way the ſame it was,</hi> &amp;c. of all which I do not remember that I have in that my paragraff ſo much as any one word. Sir, either ſpeak to my diſcours as you finde it, or els hold your peace.</p>
            <p>As if then you had overheard me afore-hand, to give you this deſerved check, at the cloſe of your chapter, you bring in ſom few words of mine, with a ſhort anſwer of your own, annext to the skirts of it; which I here ſet down as you place them your ſelf. No man can ſay, ſpeaks <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> what ill popery ever did in the world, till <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes, when it was firſt rejected. <hi>Strange,</hi> ſay you in your Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, <hi>when it did all the evils that ever were in the Chriſtian world.</hi> With the Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks unity ever dwelt. <hi>Never.</hi> Proteſtants know their neighbour catholiks, not their religion. <hi>They know both.</hi> Proteſtants are beholding to Catholiks, for their benefices, books, pulpits, goſpel. <hi>For ſom, not all.</hi> The Pope was once beleeved general paſtour over all. <hi>Prove it.</hi> The ſcriptur and goſpel we had from the Pope. <hi>Not at all.</hi> You cannot beleev the ſcriptur, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the autority of the Church. <hi>We can and do.</hi> You count them who brought the ſcriptur as lyars. <hi>No otherwiſe.</hi> The goſpel ſeparated from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57771:38"/>the Church can prove nothing. <hi>Yes it ſelf.</hi> This ſhort work you make with me. And to all that ſerious diſcours of mine concerning ſcriptur, which takes up ſixteen pages in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> we have got now in reply thereunto, this your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick-confutation. <hi>Strang. Never, Know both, Som not all. Prove it. Not at all, Can and do. No otherwis. Yes it ſelf.</hi>

            <p>Your twelfth chapter meets with my hiſtory of religion, as a flint with ſteel, only to ſtrike fire. For not heeding my ſtory which is ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, temperate, and ſober, you tell another of your own, fraught with defamations and wrath, againſt all ages and people: and yet ſpeak as confidently, as calm truth could do. Firſt you ſay, that <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea was in England, but he taught the ſame religion that is in England now.</hi> But what religion is that Sir? Then, you tell us <hi>that the ſtory of Fugatius and Damian miſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Pope Eleutherius you do ſuſpect for many reaſons.</hi> But becaus you aſſign none, I am ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for moved to think they may be all reduced to one, which is, that you will not acknowledg any good thing ever to have come from <hi>Rome: Then,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ſucceeded times of luxury, ſloth, pride, ambition, ſcandalous riots, and corruption both of faith and manners, over all the Chriſtian world, both princes, prieſts, prelates and people.</hi> Not a grain of vertue or any goodnes we muſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57771:38"/>think, in ſo many Chriſtian kingdoms and ages. <hi>Then did Goths and Vandals, and other pagans overflow the Chriſtian world.</hi> To teach them we may think, how to mend their manners. <hi>Theſe pagans took at laſt to Chriſtianity.</hi> Haply, becaus it was a more looſe and wicked life, than their own pagan profeſſion. <hi>Theſe men now Chriſtened advanced the Popes autority, when Chriſtian religion was now grown degenerate.</hi> And now we come to know, how the Roman byſhop became a patriark above the reſt, by means namely of new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted pagans. It was an odde chance, they ſhould think of advancing him to what they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, either himſelf, or any other advanced before amongſt Chriſtians, whoſe rotten and corrupt faith they had lately embraced. And yet more odde and ſtrange it was, that all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould calmly ſubmit to a power, ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new by young converted pagans; no prince or byſhop either there or of any other Chriſtian Kingdom, either then or ever after to this day excepting againſt it. Had not all the byſhops and prieſts of <hi>Africa, Egypt, Syria, Thrace, Greece,</hi> and all the Chriſtian world acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a hundred experiments the ſupreme ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual autority of the Roman patriarch in all times, before this deluge of Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals? But why do I expoſtulate with you, who write theſe things not to judicious readers, but fools and children, who are not more apt to tell
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57771:39"/>a truth, then beleev a ly. But what follows next. <hi>Towards the beginning of this lurry,</hi> ſay you, <hi>were the Brittons extirpated by the Saxes, who in after-times received Auſtin from Rome, a man very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted with the Goſpel.</hi> Here's the thanks good S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath, who out of his love and tendernes to our nations welfare, after ſo long and tedious journeys, entred upon the wild for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of our paganiſme, with great hazards and inexpreſſible ſufferings of hunger, cold, and other corporal inconveniences, to communicate <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his life and grace unto our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>After this,</hi> ſay you, <hi>religion daily more and more declined till the Reformation roſe.</hi> This is the ſum of your ſtory; which if I like not, <hi>I may thank my ſelf,</hi> ſay you, <hi>for putting you in minde of it.</hi> Indeed Sir, it is ſo fals and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, and loaden with foul language, not only againſt all nations, ages and people of all conditions, but againſt the honour of ſacred goſpel it ſelf, which muſt utterly dye, and have no life or power in the world for ſo many ages together, that I think neither I, or any els can like it, that bears any reſpect either to religion, modeſty, or truth. You ſay in this your chapter that <hi>I am better at telling a tale then mannaging an argument:</hi> But I ſhall now beleev, that you are equally good at both. Popery then is nothing but vice, and Proteſtancy is all vertue. I would we could ſee where this Proteſtancy dwells.</p>

            <p>Your thirteenth chapter takes up my three following paragraffs about the <hi>hiſtory of religion;</hi> wherein, after that according to your wonted manner you tell me, that I <hi>do not my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> what this thing, that thing, the other thing means, altho it be part of my own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, you ſay at length, that <hi>ther is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as I ſpeak; make another ſtory of your own of the ſame mettle with your former, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing afreſh upon popery (by which I do not indeed know what you mean) a wain-load of adulteries, drunkennes, atheiſme, poiſonings, avarice, pride, cruelties, tumults, blaſphemy, rebellions, wars, crimes, and yet threatning to ſay, if you ſhould chance to be provoked, far harder things then theſe. Sir, may no man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a waſp, nor force you to your harder things. You are a terrible man of arms.</p>
            <p>But if this be the right character of <hi>Popery,</hi> which here and elswhere up and down your book you give us, I tell you firſt, it will be a difficult matter to know in what age or place <hi>popery</hi> moſt reigns; ſecondly, that it is a thing I am ſo far from excuſing, that I wiſh it back to the pit of hell from whence it iſſued; thirdly, that Roman catholiks, if you be indeed againſt this popery, are all on your ſide; for to my knowledg their religion is as oppoſite to it, as light to darknes, or God to Belial; laſtly, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57771:40"/>you need not be ſo tenderly fearful for the ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>popery;</hi> for honeſt men will be ready to ſtone him that teaches it; and knaves, hypocrites, adulterers, traitors, theeves, drunkards, atheiſts, rebels, if you have given a right deſcription of popery, are all Papiſts already; theſe need no converſion, the other will by no rhetorick be moved to it. Indeed you fright us all from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry. For though ſom love iniquity as it is gainful or pleaſurſom, and muſt needs ſuffer for it when they are condemned at the ſeſſions, and cannot avoid it; yet is no man willing to ſuffer either loſs of goods or impriſonment, death or baniſhment, for the bare name of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that hath neither good nor gain in it. In a word, wicked men will act your popery, but not own it. And they which own a popery, which I ſee you are not acquainted withall, will not only diſlike others, but hate themſelvs, if through any frailty or paſſion they ſhould ever fall into any article of your <hi>Popery</hi> here deſcribed. Good Sir, take heed of blaſpheming that innocent Catholik flock, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God watch over to protect them. Be afraid to curs them, whom God hath bleſſed, or impoſe that upon their Religion, which it deteſts.</p>

            <p>Your fourteenth chapter, which is upon my title of <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> labours to ſhow that ſom of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57771:40"/>the <hi>contradictions,</hi> which I mentioned in <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> to be put upon popery, are no <hi>contradictions</hi> at all; and labour may. Well Sir, although ſlanders put upon them be never ſo contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and oppoſite, yet muſt they have patience. All is true enough, if it be but bad enough. While our Kings reign in peace, then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts religion is perſecuted, as contrary to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: when we have deſtroyed that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then is the papiſt haraſſed, ſpoiled, pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, murdered, becaus their religion is wholly addicted to monarchy, and papiſts are all for Kings. Have not theſe things been done over and over, within the ſpace of a few years here lately in <hi>England?</hi> All men now alive have been eye-witneſſes of it. Theſe things as put upon papiſts ceas to be contradictions: And if they ſhould be contradictions, both parts are therfor true in our countrey logick, becaus they are put upon papiſts. Is there not ſomething of the power of darknes in this?</p>
            <p>One latin word of mine which ſhuts up that my paragraff of <hi>Diſcovery. Ejice ancillam cum puero ſuo,</hi> becaus I engliſh it not, you tranſlate it for me, or rather interpret it, <hi>Banniſh all men out of England but Papiſts:</hi> this according to your gloſs muſt be my meaning. And you ſeem to exult, that <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> who in outward ſhow pretends ſo much moderation, ſhould let fall a word that betrayes no little miſchief in his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57771:41"/>heart. Good Lord whither does paſſion hutry mans ſpirit! All that period of mine in the end of the foreſaid § is but meerly coppied out of one of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> letters, which he wrote to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the fourth chapter of that Epiſtle, wherein thoſe very words, alluding to a paſſage in <hi>Moſes</hi> his pentateuch, are expreſt. Do you either read in your Engliſh Bible, <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all men out of England,</hi> or underſtand any ſuch meaning of <hi>Ejice ancillam cum puero ſuo?</hi> Gal. 4.30. Pray peruſe the ten laſt verſes of that chapter attentively; and ſee if I have not in my diſcours ſo coppied out their meaning and very words too, ſo far as it behooved; that I have done nothing els. <hi>Abraham had two ſons,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, one of a handmaid, the other of a free woman,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe things are an allegory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But as then, he that was born after the fleſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now. But what ſaith the ſcriptur? Caſt out the bondwoman with her ſon: for the ſon of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free-woman,</hi> &amp;c. Pray tell me ſoberly; Did the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mean by thoſe words, <hi>Caſt out the Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her ſon,</hi> that the ſons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould be put to the ſword, or baniſht out of their kingdom? Now pray hear my diſcours which I coppied out of that original; <hi>If my reader here be cautious, he may eaſily diſcern a reaſon, why all theſe ſects are ſo loiſterous one againſt another, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57771:41"/>every one of them againſt the Roman catholik. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael diſturbed the whole hous, and was ever quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and buſtling againſt Iſaac. The reaſon is the ſame both here and there. I ſmael was a natural ſon, and Iſaac the legitimate heir. And natural ſons be generally ſeditious, violent and clamorous. As I ſmael therfor was Iſaac his natural brother; ſo is a Proteſtant Miniſter but the by-blow of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Prieſt; the Presbyterian likewiſe to him: and ſo forward, till you com to the Quaker, who was begot by a deluſion, and brought into the world by a fright: his hand is againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him. The remedy and only means of peace is, Ejice ancillam cum puero ſuo.</hi> Theſe be my words out of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and what is his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the ſame is mine. But you will have me in ſpight of my teeth, becaus I ſpeak nothing but good, ſtill to mean ſom evil. I thought S. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant by thoſe words, if I muſt needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my underſtanding to you, that the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Iſaacs</hi> were the only ſons of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed love and favour, the inheritance of which bleſſing boiſterous <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> can never work out to themſelvs, by all their perſecutions and buſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling contentions. And according to this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I concluded, that to conſider and think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of this, were the only remedy and means of peace amongſt us here in <hi>England. Ejice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillam cum puero ſuo</hi> is an antidote againſt all contentious emulations, which are a ſuſpicious
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57771:42"/>mark not of an elect, but of a reprobate. But whatever I ſay, I muſt neither think, nor mean, but what you will have me to do; and that ſhall ſtill be ſomthing that is odious. An em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem hereof was the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which in <hi>Moſes</hi> hand was a walking-ſtaff, but out of it a ſerpent.</p>

            <p>In your fifteenth chapter, upon my paragraff of <hi>Meſſach,</hi> you are in a mighty plunge what this <hi>Meſſach</hi> ſhould be, and what the <hi>etimology</hi> of that word. <hi>Latin</hi> it is not, <hi>greek</hi> it is not, and you are ſure it is not <hi>hebrew;</hi> ſurely it is, ſay you, <hi>ſome uncouth word, like that of the Gnoſticks Paldabaoth.</hi> Alas good Sir, it is Engliſh, a pure Engliſh word; uſed here in <hi>England</hi> all the Saxons time, and ſom hundred years after the conqueſt, till the French monoſyllable had by little and little worn out the laſt ſyllable of the word. And you may find it yet in the old Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laws which I have read my ſelf, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of King <hi>Ina,</hi> if I rightly remember the name, which be yet extant, wherin ſtrict care and proviſion is made, that a due reverence be kept by all people in the Church all the time of their <hi>Meſſach,</hi> which now we call <hi>Meſs</hi> or <hi>Maſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then having laughed at my admiration of catholik Service, you carp at me for ſaying that the <hi>firſt Chriſtians were never called together to hear a ſermon;</hi> and to convince me, you bring
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57771:42"/>
               <hi>ſom places out of S. Pauls Epiſtles, and the Acts, which commend the miniſtery of the word:</hi> This indeed is your uſual way of refuting my ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; you flouriſh copiouſly in that which is not at all againſt me, and never apply it to my words, leſt it ſhould appear, as it is, impertinent. I deny not that people were by Gods word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or that converts were further inſtructed, or that the preaching of Gods word is good and uſeful many wayes; but that which I ſay is, that primitive. Chriſtians were never called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for that end, as the great work of their Chriſtianity. This I have ſo clearly proved, both in the ſecond dialogue of the <hi>Reclaimed Papiſt,</hi> and alſo in the foreſaid paragraff of <hi>Meſſach,</hi> that you divert from that, to declaim of the neceſſity and excellency of preaching, and bring neither text nor reaſon that may reach to my words at all.</p>
            <p>You go on, and wonder much, that <hi>we ſhould hear nothing in ſcriptur of this Chriſtian ſacrifice, if any ſuch were.</hi> Sir, you will neither hear nor ſee. But, ſay you, <hi>the paſsion of our Lord is our Chriſtian ſacrifice.</hi> Do not I ſay ſo too? But that this incruent ſacrifice was inſtituted by the ſame Lord before his death, to figur out daily before our eyes that paſſion of his, which was then approaching, in commemoration of his death, ſo long as the world ſhould laſt; this, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ho I plainly ſpeak it, you take no notice of it.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57771:43"/>But <hi>the Judaical ſacrifice,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is ſaid by the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the Hebrews, in this to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the ſacrifice of Chriſtians, that ours was don but once, theirs often.</hi> It is true, the ſacrifice of our Lords paſſion, of which the apoſtle in that whole diſcours only treats, in oppoſition to that of bulls and goats, was ſo don but once, that it could not be don twice. But as the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the old law, were inſtituted by almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, to be often iterated before the paſſion of the Meſſias for a continual exerciſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo did the ſame Lord for the very ſame purpos of religious exerciſe, inſtitute another to be iterated after his death; unto which it were to have reference, when it ſhould be paſt, as the former had to the ſame death, when it was to com. And it hath a reference ſo much the more excellent, as that it doth by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of the ſame Meſſias, exhibit to the faith of his beleevers, that very true real body as crucified amongſt us, whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Moſaical ſacrifices gave meerly a ſhadow. Did not our Lord do this? Were not the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles according to this rite <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſacrificing to our great Lord God, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was by impoſition of hands ſegregated from the laiety for his divine ſervice, as I clearly in that my paragraff evince out of the hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the apoſtles. <hi>No,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were not then about any ſacrifice, but only
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57771:43"/>preaching Gods word, or ſom ſuch thing to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the name and behalf of God.</hi> But Sir, is this to be in earneſt or to jeſt? The ſacred text ſayes, they were ſacrificing to our Lord, liturgying, and miniſtring to him. You ſay, <hi>They were not ſacrificing to God, but only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people.</hi> And now the queſtion is, whether you or I more rightly underſtand that Apoſtoloicall book.

            <p>Your ſeventeenth chapter upon my paragraff of <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> nibbles at more of my diſcours made in that one paragraff, then you have taken notice of in ten of my others. <hi>A
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57771:44"/>man,</hi> ſay you, <hi>may indeed have ſuch thoughts of devotion, as Fiat Lux ſpeaks of, upon the ſight of images, which be ſees banging in Churches, if he be a man diſtraught of his wits, not if he be himſelf and ſober.</hi> So then; mad men it ſeems can tell what figures repreſent, ſober and wiſe men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Again, <hi>The violation of an image,</hi> ſay you <hi>redounds to the prototype, if it be rightly and duly repreſented, not els.</hi> And when then is Chriſt crucified, for example, rightly and duly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented? Are you one of thoſe mad men can tell what figures repreſent, yea or no. <hi>The hanging up of traitors in effigie is don,</hi> ſay you, <hi>only to make a declaration of the fact, and not to caſt a diſhonour upon the perſon.</hi> So you ſay: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus you know it don long after the fact has rung all the whole Kingdom over; and don, not in places of concours, but ignominy; not in the <hi>Exchange,</hi> but <hi>Tyburn;</hi> not with any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters declaring the fact, but with a halter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, to denote the death and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inflicted, as far as is poſſible, upon him. You go on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where the Pſalmiſt complains of Gods enemies breaking down his ſculptures, he means not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any images or figures, but only wainſcot or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ceiling.</hi> Surely the Prophet wanted a word then to expreſs himſelf, or tranſlatours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Prophet. If we muſt gueſs at his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without heeding his words, one might
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57771:44"/>think it as probable, what alſo holy ſcripture tells us, that the hous of God was ordained with ſculptures of <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and other angels, to repreſent his true hous that is above; as with the circles, quadrats, triangels, rhombos, and rhomboides of wainſcot. <hi>The eye,</hi> ſay you again, <hi>may not have her ſpecies as well as the ear, becaus God has commanded the one and not the other.</hi> This Sir you only ſay. <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> makes it appear, that God commands and commends both, and the nature of man requires both: nor can you give any reaſon, why I may not look upon him who was crucified, as well as hear of him. You adde. <hi>Nor is the ſole end of preaching as Fiat Lux would have it, only to move the mind of the hearers unto correſponding affections.</hi> Why do not you ſay then, what els it is for? you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my words, but declare your ſelf no other end, but what I have in thoſe ſhort words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. You may haply conceal in your heart ſom other end of your preaching, which you are loath to ſpeak; as to procure applaus, to vent your rhetorick, to get good benefices, to ſhow your fine cloth and ſilks, your pure neat white ſtarched bands and cuffs, button'd handkerchiefs and ladies gloves, to inflame factions, get wives, or the like; but I could not think of all things at once; nor needed I to expreſs any more, then that one end of preaching which is conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, apoſtolical, and legal. You go on.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57771:45"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>God indeed commanded the Cherubims to be ſet upon the ark, but thoſe cherubims were images of nothing; of what ſhould they be images? Nor were they ſet up to be adored. Beſides God who commanded them to be ſet up, did no more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay his own prohibition of images to be made, than he contradicted his own rule which forbids to ſteal, when he commanded his people to ſpoil the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But Sir, ſince the real Cherubims are not made of our beaten gold, thoſe ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be only figures. And of what els ſhould they be figures but of thoſe real ones. Nor is it either to my purpos or yours, that they are ſet up to be adored. For images in catholick Churches, are not ſet up for any ſuch purpos; nor do I any where ſay it. No man alive has any ſuch thought, nor tradition, no councel hath delivered it, no practis infers it. Chriſtian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers or Schoolmen have indeed raiſed a philoſophical queſtion; <hi>Whether any reſpect may be terminated upon the figure,</hi> purely as it ſuch an abſolute entity in it ſelf, beſides that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive one that falls only upon the prototype: But what they queſtion, or what they talk, or what they reſolve, does no more belong, becaus they ſay it, unto catholik faith, then if they had been aſleep and ſaid nothing. All catholik councels and practis declares ſuch ſacred figures, to be expedient aſſiſtants to our thoughts in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meditation and prayers: and that is all that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57771:45"/>I know of it. And the relative reſpect that is given to any figur as it is ſuch a figur, whether in a glaſs, or in any more fixed poſtur to ſupply the defects of a mirrour, that it terminates na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally upon the ſampler or prototype is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to right reaſon and philoſophy. And it cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>That which you ſpeak of the Iſraelites ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Egyptians by Gods command, hath ſom ſpecies of an argument in it. But Sir, we muſt know, you as well as I, that God who forbids men to ſteal, did not then command to ſteal, as you ſay he did, when he bad his people ſpoil the Egyptians under the ſpecies of a loan. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things legitimate that their act of ſpoil, and clear it from any notion of theft or robbery or ſtealing. Firſt, they might have of themſelvs a right to thoſe few goods, in ſatisfaction of the long oppreſſion they had unjuſtly undergon: and it may be that in that their great haſte, their own allowance was not then paid them. But ſecondly, becaus it is a thing of danger, that any ſervant ſhould be allowed to right himſelf, by putting his hand to his maſters goods, though his caſe of wrong be never ſo clear, therfor did the command of God intervene to juſtifie their action. And the abſolute dominion of the whole earth and all that is in it, being inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the hands of God, made that by Gods expreſs command to be truly now and juſtly the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57771:46"/>Hebrews right, which by an inferiour and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate title, ſuch as is in the hand of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, belonged to the Egyptians before. So that the Hebrews in taking thoſe goods with them, did not ſteal: nor did God command them to ſteal, when he bad them carry thoſe goods of the Egyptians with them; for that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that very command of God they now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the Egyptians any more. But this can no wayes be applied to the buſines of <hi>Images:</hi> nor could God command the Hebrews to make any images, if he had abſolutely forbidden to have any at all made. For this concerns not any affair between neighbour and neighbour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſupreme Lord hath abſolute dominion, but the ſervice only and adoration due from man to his maker, which God being eſſentially good and immutably true, cannot alter or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens with. Nor doth it ſtand with his natur and deity to chang, diſpens, or vary the firſt table of his law concerning himſelf; I mean as to the ſubſtance of it, by commanding us now to have but one God, then to worſhip two; now not to take his name in vain, and then to blaſpheme it, as he may do the ſecond, which concerns neighbours; for want of that domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over himſelf, which he hath over any creature, to give or take away its right, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv or deſtroy it, as himſelf pleaſes. God may diſable my neighbours right, and inable me to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57771:46"/>take to may ſelf that which before was his, but he cannot command me to commit idolatry or diſhonour himſelf. If he ſhould deny himſelf, he would not be God. From hence it muſt needs follow, that if it be the ſens and mind of the almighty, that to ſet up any images in Churches be derogatory to his glory, then could not God poſſibly command any to be there ſet up. For theſe two precepts, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet up images,</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet up none,</hi> are not only contradictory in terms of the law propoſed, enounced and promulgated, but infer alſo in God himſelf that contradiction, oppoſition and ſelf-denial, which is inconſiſting with ſuch an unchangeable veracity. God may poſſibly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me either to curs or ſpoil my neighbour, or in a caſe expreſt not to help him; but he ſhould deny himſelf, (which the deity cannot do) if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould command me to blaſpheme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the honour due to him either to refuſe it him, or give it to another. When therfor one and the ſame God ſo often forbids his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make to <hi>themſelvs</hi> any images; and yet in the ſame divine law commands them to ſet up Cherubims in his own temple; it cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a concernment of his worſhip, be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meant, than that they ſhould make no ſculptures or figures, but what himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and which may aſſuredly repreſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dear to himſelf, as <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> interprets it.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57771:47"/>And if an image in it ſelf be oppoſite to Gods glory, as Anticatholiks think; then could not God poſſibly command the making or ſetting up of any, in his holy temple or place of divine worſhip. But you go on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiat Lux ſayes, God forbad forreign images, ſuch as Moloch, Dagon, and Aſtaroth, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his own. But Fiat lux is deceived in this as well as other things, for God forbad any likeneſſes of himſelf; and he gives the reaſon, becaus, ſaith he, in Horeb ye ſaw no ſimilitude of me.</hi> Sir, you may know and conſider, that the ſtatues and graven images of the heathens, towards whoſe land <hi>Iſrael</hi> then in the wilderneſs was journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to enter and take poſſeſſion, were ever made by the pagans to repreſent God, and not any devils, although they were deluded in it. And therfor were they called the <hi>gods</hi> of the mountains, the <hi>gods</hi> of the valleys, the <hi>gods</hi> of <hi>Accaron, Moab, &amp;c.</hi> Ther was therfor good reaſon, that the Hebrews, who ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from ſuch ſnares, ſhould be forbidden to make to <hi>themſelvs</hi> any ſimilitude or likenes of God. What figur or ſimilitude the true God had allowed his people, that let them hold and uſe, until the fulneſs of time ſhould com, when the figur of his ſubſtance, the ſplendour of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and only image of his natur ſhould appear. And now good Sir, ſince God has been pleaſed to ſhow us his face, pray give Chriſtians leav to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57771:47"/>uſe, and keep, and honour it. If you be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, and take pleaſur in defacing his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs, I think they have good reaſon on their ſides, who honour them. You proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a pretty fanſy in Fiat Lux, to ſay we have as well a precept, Thou ſhalt make graven ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as we have, Thou ſhalt not. I wonder where Fiat Lux finds that precept, ſith all ancients have it, and all tranſlations read it, Thou ſhalt not.</hi> What is that <hi>It</hi> they have, what is that <hi>It</hi> they read? Do you think that <hi>Fiat lux</hi> reads one and the ſame text, both <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt not. Moſes</hi> his <hi>making,</hi> and the <hi>command given him to make Cherubims,</hi> is a rule good enough to <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> that ſom images may be made, and ſet up in Churches: as alſo is that precept, <hi>Thou ſhall not make to thy ſelf any images,</hi> another rule to ſhow him, that ſom ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we are not to make <hi>to our ſelves</hi> on our own heads, in imitation of pagans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No leſs whimſical,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is that relation Fiat lux ſayes an image hath to ſom one Prototype, for example, to S. Peter rather then to Simon Magus: for ther can be no relation, but what the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of the framer or ſpectatour makes.</hi> Sir, ſpeaking as I do of a formal repreſentation or relation, and not of the efficient caus of it, I cannot but wonder at this your illogical aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Is the pictur made by the ſpectatours ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to repreſent this or that thing? or the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57771:48"/>imagination rather guided to it by the pictur? By this rule of yours the image of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> did not my imagination help it, would no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a man than a mous. I know the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can, for want of real picturs, make fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical ones to its ſelf; in the clouds, walls, air, or fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when ſhe hath real ones, made her either by art or natur, ſhe cannot make them to be otherwayes then they are; nor think or ſay, except ſhe will abuſe her ſelf to deriſion, that a cat is a dog, or an oxe a hare. Nor does it help you at all, that ther may be miſtakes; for we treat not here of the errours but natures of things. And you will not I hope maintain, that ther is no real heat any where, but what the imagination makes, becaus the good poor man of <hi>Norway</hi> ſent out of his own countrey upon an errand, ſtood warming his fingers there, at a hedg of red roſes.</p>

            <p>Your eighteenth chapter, which is upon my paragraff of <hi>Tongues</hi> or <hi>Latin ſervice,</hi> hath ſom colour of plauſibility. But becaus you neither do, nor will underſtand the cuſtoms of that Church, which you are eager to oppoſe; all your words are but wind. I have heard many grave proteſtant divines, ingeniouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that divine comfort and ſanctity of life requiſite to ſalvation which religion aims at, may with more perfection and leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57771:48"/>be attained by the cuſtoms of the Roman Church, which gives the ſenſe, life, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods word to the people, without the hard ſhell of the letter, than that of ours, which gives it in the ſhell to break peoples teeth. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not to ſit pierching upon the lips, but to be got by heart, it conſiſts not in reading but doing; and in this, not in that, lives the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, which is ſoon and eaſily conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Chriſt our Lord drew a compendium of all divine truths into two words, which his great apoſtle again abridged into one. And if the ſeveral goſpels for every day in the year, which are or may be in the hands of all catholiks, the chiefeſt particles of divine epiſtles, books of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory and meditation upon all the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſalvation, and ſpiritual treatiſes for all occaſions and uſes, which be numberles amongſt catholiks, adjoyned to the many ſeveral rites of examination of conſcience, daily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual practis of prayer and faſting, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly commemoration of the things God hath wrought for us throughout the year, which all by law are tied to obſerv, and do obſerv them, may not give a ſufficient acquaintance of what concerns our ſalvation, and promote them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough towards it, I am to ſeek what it is that can; or what further good it may do, to read the letter of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> epiſtles, to the <hi>Romans</hi> for example, or <hi>Corinthians,</hi> wherin queſtions,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57771:49"/>and caſes and theological diſcourſes are treated, that vulgar people can neither underſtand, nor are at all concerned to know. And I pray you tell me ingeniouſly, and without heat, what more of good could accrew to any by the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated letter of a book, whereof I will be bold to ſay, that nine parts in ten concern not my particular, either to know or practis, than by the conceived ſubſtance of Gods will to me, and my own duty towards him? or what is ther now here in <hi>England</hi> when the letter of ſcriptur is ſet open to every mans eye, any more either of peace or charity, piety or juſtice, than in former catholik times, when the ſubſtance of Gods word and will was given people in ſhort, and the obſervance of their duty prolixly preſt upon them. What did they do in thoſe ancient catholik times? they flockt every day in the week to their Churches, which ſtood continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open, there to pray and meditate, and renew their good purpoſes; they ſung pſalms, hymns, and canticles all over the land both day and night; they built all our churches, that we have at this day remaining amongſt us, and as many more, which we have razed and pulled down; they founded our univerſities, eſtabliſhed our laws, ſet out tythes and glebe-land for their clergy, built hoſpitals, erected corporations; in a word, did all the good things we found don for our good in this our native kingdom.

               </hi> out of greek in the Eaſtern part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, or latin in the Weſtern: You ſlight this diſcours of mine, becaus hebrew, greek, and latin was, ſay you, vulgar tongues themſelvs. I know this well enough. But when and how long ago were they ſo? not for ſom
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57771:50"/>hundreds of years to my knowledge. And was the Bible, Pſalms, or Chriſtian liturgy then put into vulgar tongues, when thoſe they were firſt writ in, ceaſed to be vulgar? This you ſhould have ſpoke to, if you had meant to ſay any thing, or gain-ſay me. Nor is it to purpos, to tell me that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> tranſlated the Bible into <hi>Dalmatian;</hi> I know well enough it has been ſo tranſlated by ſome ſpecial perſons into <hi>Gothiſh, Armenian, Ethiopian,</hi> and other particular dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects. But did the Church either of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews or Chriſtians, either greek or latin, ever deliver it ſo tranſlated to the generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or uſe it in their ſervice, or command it ſo to be don, as a thing of general concernment and neceſſity? So far is it from this, that they would never permit it. This I ſaid, and I firſt ſaid it, before you ſpoke, and your meer gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay without further reaſon or probability of proof cannot diſpoſſes me.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Couſins,</hi> now byſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> lately ſojourneying in <hi>Paris,</hi> when he underſtood of a grecian byſhops arrival there, did with ſome other Engliſh Gentlemen in his company give him a viſit, and with the ſame or like company went afterwards to ſee him. The articles of our Engliſh Church were tranſlated into greek, and ſhown him. Many queſtions were asked him about the ſervice of the grecian Church, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead, invocation of Saints, real
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57771:50"/>preſence, confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dr. <hi>Couſins</hi> can tell himſelf what anſwer he received from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable grave prelate <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>Trapeſond;</hi> for that was his name and title. In brief, he owned not thoſe articles, as any way conſonant to the faith of the Greeks, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and had ever practiſed the contrary. He alſo told them diſtinctly and openly, that <hi>Maſs</hi> or <hi>Liturgy</hi> was, and had ever been the great work of their Chriſtianity all over the greek Church; that confeſſion of ſins to a prieſt, praying for the dead, invocation of ſaints, and ſuch like points wherein we in <hi>England</hi> differ from papiſts, were all great parts of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and their conſtant practis. Finally, he let them know, that all the Liturgies, both thoſe of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> were ever kept in the learned greek, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the vulgar language. And withall ſhowed his own greek book of <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which he uſed himſelf at the altar. Dr. <hi>Couſins</hi> did himſelf ſee him officiate with his lay-brother a monk of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> belonging to St. <hi>Catherins</hi> monaſtery in mount <hi>Sina,</hi> miniſtring to him at the altar; and found both by his words and practis, that in all thoſe and other eſſential parts and obſervances of Chriſtianity the Greeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed perfectly with the Roman Church. This teſtimony, Sir, of a venerable arch-byſhop, to ſuch a worthy perſon as Dr. <hi>Couſins,</hi> might I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57771:51"/>ſhould think ſuffice to juſtifie my words, and make you beleev with me, that Chriſtian Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies have ever been uſed, as <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> ſpeaks in a learned language diſtinct from the vulgar. But we need not go far from home for a teſtimony. Neither the Bible nor Service-book was ever ſeen here in <hi>England</hi> for a thouſand years ſpace in any other language but Latin, before <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt dayes, (except haply the Pſalter, which the Saxons and almoſt all people, have ever had in their own tongue, being a chief part of Chriſtians devotion) nor in Brittiſh or Welch, before the byſhop of S. <hi>Aſaphs</hi> tranſlation. And yet the people all that while wanted no know-knowledge of Gods will, or comfort of his word.</p>
            <p>You mightily inſult over me in your 336 page, for ſaying, that the <hi>bible was kept by the Hebrews in an ark or tabernacle,</hi> not touched by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but brought out at times to the prieſt, that he might inſtruct the people out of it. Here, ſay you, the <hi>authour of Fiat Lux betrayes his groſs ignorance and ſomthing more: for the ark was place in ſanctum ſanctorum, and not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the prieſt only once a year, wheras the people were weekly inſtructed.</hi> But Sir, do I ſpeak there of any <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> or of any ark in that place? Was ther, or could ther be no more arks but one? If you had been only in theſe latter dayes, in any ſynagogue or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57771:51"/>of Jews, you might have ſeen even now how the bible is kept ſtill with them in an ark or tabernacle, in imitation of their fore-fathers, when they have now no <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. You may alſo diſcern, how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtom, they cringe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the bringing out of the bible, which is the only ſolemn adoration left amongſt them; and that there be more arks than that in <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum.</hi> If I had called it a <hi>box</hi> or <hi>cheſt</hi> or <hi>cupboard,</hi> you had let it paſs. But I uſed the word <hi>Ark</hi> as more ſacred.</p>

            <p>I diſcerned in your nineteenth chapter, which is upon my paragraff of <hi>Communion in one kind,</hi> a ſomwhat more than ordinary ſwelling choller; which moved me to look over that my paragraff afreſh.

            <p>Ther is in your twentieth chapter, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes my paragraff of <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Hero's,</hi> one word of yours, that requires my notice. I ſay in that my paragraff, that the pagans derided the ancient Chriſtians for three of their uſages. Firſt, for <hi>eating their own God:</hi> Secondly, for <hi>kneeling to the Prieſts genitals:</hi> Thirdly, for <hi>worſhipping an aſſes head.</hi> This laſt you except againſt, and impute my ſtory <hi>to my own ſimplicity and ignorance, if not to ſomthing wors; for that imputation,</hi> ſay you, <hi>was not laid upon Chriſtians at all, but only upon Jews, as may be ſeen in Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> &amp;c. But Sir, you may know, that <hi>in odioſis</hi> the primitive Chriſtians were ever numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews; and what evil report lay upon theſe, was charged alſo upon them, though ſomtimes upon another ground. And although <hi>Joſephus</hi> may excuſe the Jews, and not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; yet a long while after his time, if not even then alſo, that ſlander was generally all over the pagan world charged upon Chriſtians alſo, as may be read in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other ancient writers; yea and very probably, by the very Jews themſelvs, who bitterly hated them, caſt off from themſelvs upon the poor Chriſtians
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57771:52"/>on another account, which I ſpecified in <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> And through the whole Roman Empire did the ſound of this ſcandal ring up and down for ſom ages together. Inſomuch that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> himſelf conceited, that as the Chriſtian religion was derived from the Jews; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the imputation of the <hi>aſſes head,</hi> firſt put upon the Jews, might from them be derived upon Chriſtian religion. And the ſame <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick</hi> addes theſe words: <q>The calumnies, ſaith he, invented to cry down our religion grew to ſuch exceſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, that not long ago in this very city, a pictur of our God was ſhown by a certain infamous perſon, with the ears of an aſs, and a hoof on one of his feet, clothed with a gown, and a book in his hand; with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>This is Onochoetes the God of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> And he addes, that the Chriſtians in the city, as they were much offended with the impiety; ſo did they not a little wonder at the ſtrange uncouth name the vaillain had put upon their lord and maſter; <hi>Onochoetes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, he muſt be called <hi>Onochoetes.</hi>
               </q> And are not you Sir a ſtrange man, to tell me, page 393. that what <hi>I ſpeak of this buſineſs is notoriouſly fals, nay and that I know it is fals, and I cannot produce one authentick teſtimony, no not one of any ſuch things.</hi> But this is but your ordinary confidence.</p>

            <p>Another argument of yours expreſt in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty places of your Animadverſions, by which you would diſſipate at once great part of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> into the air, does as finely cant, as this does courſly defy. <hi>The religion,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that is now profeſt in England, is that and only that which was firſt in ancient times received here,</hi> &amp;c. This you ſpeak, and the more confidently do you ſpeak it, the leſs ſignificant you know your words be, and yet ſounding well enough for your deſign. What do you mean I pray you Sir, by <hi>that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is now profeſt in England?</hi> Why do you not ſpecify it? Speak it in down-right lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Is it <hi>Popery</hi> that has been peaceably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the land for almoſt a thouſand years, and did all the good things we now finde in it; as yet profeſt by ſom? No; this you will deny. Is it <hi>Prelate-Proteſtancy</hi> that for threeſcore years
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57771:54"/>oppreſt Popery here? If you had ſaid this, you had praiſed that too much, which your ſelf approves not. Is it <hi>Presbytery</hi> that warred the laſt twenty years, and utterly deſtroyed the foreſaid Proteſtancy? In ſaying this you had to your own danger diſabled the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, now to the great heart-burning of the Presbyterians eſtabliſht again by law. Is it <hi>Independency,</hi> that for ſix or ſeven years curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Presbyterian here, in —Tectour <hi>Olivers</hi> time, and had almoſt paſt an Act for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the three P. P. P. Papiſh, Proteſtant, and Presbyterian. It is <hi>Quakery,</hi> that is now far enough ſpread, and openly profeſt by many, and judges the Papiſt ſtark naught, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant half rotten, the Presbyterian a quarter addle, and other Independents imperfect? Is it ſom general <hi>abſtracted religion,</hi> that is common to them all? If it be ſo, then Popery as well as any other may be juſtly ſtiled the religion here firſt received. For that common notion in whatever you ſhall ſay it conſiſts, ſo it be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as it ought to be, will be found firſt and principally in the Papiſts faith. But this you have not thought good your ſelf to expres, that you may ſeem to expres ſomthing, that may be thought good to your ſelf, and ill to me. But you muſt deal candidly with me: I am an old oxe that hath fixed his foot firmly, and am not to be out-braved either with your cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57771:55"/>words or paſſionate execrations.</p>
            <p>I had told you Sir, of all your tricks from page to page in particular, if nothing had been required at my hands to write, but only my own reply: but being, if I ſhould do ſo, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſet down your talk too, I think it not worth either my charge or labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon you ſuch your voluminous imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies. And I have I aſſure you taken notice of all in your book, that may ſeem to have any appearance of reaſon in it, (though really ther be none at all againſt me) and is not either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly untrue, or abſolutely improper. This is all.</p>
            <p>And now good Sir, I could wiſh you had given me the firſt letter of your name; that I might have known how to ſalute you. I have been told of late, that the Authour of the <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> is one Doctour <hi>O. N,</hi> a Proteſtant againſt Popery which you found down, a Presbyterian againſt Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which you threw down, an Independent againſt Presbyterianry which you kept down. But whether you be Doctour <hi>O. N,</hi> or to turn your inſide outwards, you be <hi>N. O</hi> Doctour; ſince I cannot be aſſured, it ſhall be all one to me. All that I have undertook at this time is to let you know, who ever you be, that I have read over your <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon my <hi>Fiat.</hi> And I thank you for your book; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57771:55"/>
               <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> and all the whole deſign of it, I think irrefragably. It ſhows to the eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally verrifies by your own example, what <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> did but ſpeak in words: namely that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of religion are endles for want of ſome one thing to fix upon, which may not be depraved; that they are fraught with unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table animoſities, which darken the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deprave good manners; that they are mutable as mens fanſies be, which can never be fixedly ſtated, ſith every man hath a ſpirit, hath a method, hath an opinion of his own, and ſayes and denyes with endles diverſity; that they are guileful and deluſory, ſometimes fals on both ſides, ever on one, and yet ſtill made out with ſubtil words, ſo plauſible to the eye and ear, that men employed in the multitude of affairs and troubles of this world, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to diſintangle thoſe knots of <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> then eſpecially at a loſs, when they conſider, that ſuch as mannage thoſe diſputes are all of them intereſted perſons; fiftly, that they are mad and irrational, while all parties pretend one and the ſame rule of holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptur, and yet will admit of no exteriour viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judg in their viſible exteriour conteſts: laſtly, that they are miſchievous and fatal to all places where they riſe: as they have been of late to this our diſtreſſed Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> where diſputes and controverſies about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57771:56"/>raiſed to a height, by the inferiour ſcribes againſt their prelates, drew after them pikes and guns to make them good for twenty years together, with much deſolation and ruin; which times I think I may not unjuſtly call the <hi>Vicars Wars.</hi> For the inferiour prieſts and levites, envying the dignities, glory and revenues of their prelates, when they could not otherwiſe get them into their own hands, by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable tones in <hi>Eloimi,</hi> raiſed up the people of the land, to further their deſign. This trick of theirs they learned from wolves. For theſe, when they ſpy a waifaring man whom they would devour, and yet by a narrow ſearch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv him to be too ſtrong for them, ſtarting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide upon ſom <hi>hillock;</hi> there ſet upon their tails, they howl for help.</p>
            <p>And if any will not beleev <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> that ſuch be the fruits of diſputes and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſuch their nature and <hi>genius,</hi> let them beleev the Authour of <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> who as he ſayes what he pleaſes, and denies what he liſts; ſo to his frequent reproaches, villifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſlanders he adjoyns his own Menaces of terrour, to make my words good, and juſtify <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You frequently threaten me, that if I write again, I ſhall <hi>hear more,</hi> far more than you have ſaid in your <hi>Animadverſions;</hi> but I promis you Sir, if you write again, you ſhall never hear
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57771:56"/>more from me. For now the flies begin to com into my chamber, which may haply expect I ſhould heed their flight and hearken to their buzz; and I muſt not leav thoſe greater em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments to look upon your <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> or any your other books. Farewell.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now about a year, ſince Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> made his pretty featous Sermon in the Court: where, by vertue of thoſe few words of his text, <hi>In the beginning it was not ſo, Matth.</hi> 19.8. he confuted all Popery in the ſpace of one hour, as a meer bundle of novelties. The Treatiſe you left here in the hands of ſom friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your departure to <hi>Paris,</hi> to prove againſt the tenour of the ſaid Sermon, <hi>That Catholik doctrines are no novelties,</hi> printed afterward by I know not what good hand, gave us here in <hi>England,</hi> after your departur, a great deal of good ſatisfaction. This book of yours about a moneth or two after it was extant, was ſeconded by another, againſt Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> penned by <hi>Jo. Sim.</hi> a ſmall, but a very quick and lively piece, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate his reaſons. So that <hi>Pierce</hi> had now two adverſaries againſt him.</p>
            <p>The latter <hi>J. S.</hi> hears not yet of any reply. But your book Sir is lately anſwered, not by Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> himſelf, (who hath other irons in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57771:59"/>fire, and meets now with ſomthing in his own life, which in the beginning was not ſo) but by one Mr. <hi>Daniel Whitby,</hi> a young man, of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpirit, and poſſeſt as it ſeems of a fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed library, who hath undertaken, or is willing atleaſt to undergo the quarrel. This book of <hi>Whitbyes,</hi> wherof my antient love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath here invited me to give you a brief account, is a great volum of 512 pages, ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the ſeed of controverſie, when it is once ſown, to increaſe and multiply. A compendium it is, I think, of his whole library.</p>
            <p>Whether this book of his be made up all by one hand, by reaſon of the unity of the name, and diverſity of ſtiles diſcerned in it, is not eaſy to gueſs. But that Mr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> if he had many coadjutors with him, either in his own chamber or abroad, ſhould by their mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, alone reap the honour of all their labours, wherof his own part may haply be the leaſt; you need, Sir, neither grutch, nor fear, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, nor any way diſlike. The book is of that natur that it more behoovs, it ſhould be thought to iſſue from one young head, then many old ones; that the inſufficiency, when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, may be rather attributed to the weaknes of the Author, then caus he pleads for. Of this, Sir, I may out of <hi>Whitbyes</hi> own words in his Epiſtle Dedicatory, and the whole progres of his book, aſſure you; that this volume of his, is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57771:59"/>wholly made up of the many ſeveral replies of divers Proteſtant writers, who have ſtretcht their wits to the utmoſt in this laſt age, to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Catholik faith, and all their grounds, autorities and reaſons for it; not only ſuch as have written here in <hi>England,</hi> which are not a few, but thoſe alſo beyond the ſeas, who are all met friendly here together, though never ſo much differing in their wayes, twenty at leaſt or thirty of the chiefeſt, to help to make up Mr. <hi>Whitbies</hi> book.</p>
            <p>Theſe writers he tells us in his Epiſtle, ſom of them, who they be; Hammond, Field, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius, Baron, Uſher, Fern, Dally, Taylor, Crackanthorp, Hall, Andrews, Calixtus, Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Chamier and Chillingworth. But he does not there mention Pareus, Blondel, Baxter, and ſeveral others, whom in the context of his book he makes as much uſe of, as any of thoſe he there honours with the title of Champions, with whoſe ſword and buckler he means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, and knock you down. You may eaſily gueſs the reaſon. Although indeed, even Chamier, Pleſſis, and Dally, his firſt and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt three, wer as great Puritans, as <hi>Baxter, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> or <hi>Blondel,</hi> and no leſs enemies to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Proteſtant, then Roman Catholik Church. And <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, if he will but do ſo much as dye, ſhall ſeven year hence, if not ſooner, be put into the next calendar, and ſit among the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57771:60"/>Champions of the Engliſh Church, cited no more then, as guilty of faction and hereſy, but as a Protector and Patron of the truth, famous Baxter, incomparable Baxter. So p. 230. he cites Dr. Reynolds, as a great Champion of his Church, who was indeed a Champion of the Puritans againſt it. Every non-Papiſt is a good Proteſtant, eſpecially when he is dead. When they fight for their wives and children againſt catholik traditions and faith, then are they all holy zealous champions: But they are damned, and ſwerv notoriouſly from the truth, if they may be themſelvs beleeved, when they conteſt with one another; which ever happens after the firſt great victory with the common enemy obtained.</p>
            <p>One thing is ſingular in this book of <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> that he frames no anſwers out of any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own, ripened by a long and ſerious conſideration of the things he ſpeaks of, in this his reply; but recurres preſently to the books of thoſe his forenamed maſters, in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y; and againſt your reaſonings, only oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their words and fore-ſtudied evaſions, ſuch as they had invented, each one his own way, upon ſemblable occaſion; not heeding at all, whether your diſcours, againſt which he writes, hath anticipated thoſe ſhifts afore-hand, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it does, yea or no; nor how far they evacuate one another. This if he had pondred well, which perhaps poor man he could not do,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57771:60"/>it had prevented much of his collections, and ſunk his huge book into a far ſmaller bulk. <hi>To this,</hi> quoth he, <hi>hath Chamier told you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Can you not ſee what incomparable Chillingworth hath taught you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You will ſtill be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, although great Pleſsis hath informed you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where wer your eyes, when reverend Hall hath ſo plainly told you, that,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And he brings ſomtimes, not only four or five ſeveral anſwers of one author to the ſame thing, all I ſuppoſe he found there written in his book, but half a dozen of thoſe his authors, with all their manifold evaſions to one ſingle catholik ground; and for the moſt part ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, that the firſt anſwer of the firſt author hath preſently another firſt, as conſiſting of two parts; and the firſt of them may haply have another firſt; ſo that three ſucceeding periods begin oftentimes with three <hi>firſts,</hi> one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, according as he penned them hand over head out of the books he wrote, venting his reaſons, as ſom young children void worms, three or four, head and tails together. Nor heeds he at all, whether theſe his authors do chance to contradict one another, in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for which he brings them in ſo unnaturally together; one affirming what the other denies, one rejecting what the other allows, one diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing what the other abſolutely grants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This benefit he will reap by this confuſed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57771:61"/>interlocution of his maſters; that, if he com to be challenged upon any of the anſwers, which he makes by their lips, he ſhall not need, when he findes them either weak or fals, or any way prejudicial, to own then for his, what he had openly profeſt before-hand, to be another mans replies. So that they will ſerv a bird all bedecked with the feathers of many a fowl, for pride and pompous ſhow unto ſuch as will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him, and to ſuch as ſhall queſtion him, for a preſent remedy of excuſe, <hi>This is not my fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Cuckows. It is not my ſaying, but Chamiers. It is the reply of Chillingworth: It is the ſpeech of Dr. Hammond, and not any aſſertion of mine, &amp;c.</hi> What can any one do, Sir, to ſuch a man, but neglect him?</p>
            <p>Truly I look upon <hi>Whitby,</hi> as a kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Revels, that appoints other men who are to ſpeak, every one their parts, and gives them their <hi>qu</hi> of entrance, whilſt himſelf ſtands in ſom privat place to look on, and ſee how they do perform.</p>
            <p>And he provides commonly againſt any one of your catholik grounds or reaſons for it, four or five Proteſtant ſpeakers, by their ſeveral wayes to diſable it: wherof one ſhall haply ſay, that the autority you bring is good, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries another meaning; a ſecond ſhall affirm, it is naught and forged; a third ſtands indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whether it be admitted or no, but is ſure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57771:61"/>It makes againſt you; a fourth acknowledges it for your purpos, but diſparages the authour, whence it is taken; a fiſt admits both the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the author, and truth of his words, but cells you it is only one of his errors; <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> himſelf not ſaying all the while, which of all theſe replies he holds himſelf for good; but imagining you wholly oppreſt and overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his various collection of contradicting drollery, he paſſes on exulting to your next point or following reaſon, in the ſame mode and method to be cruſht.</p>
            <p>And truly Sir, one may ſee in this one book of <hi>Whitbies</hi> at a view, what a judicious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who loves to read and ponder all things ſeriouſly, cannot but obſerv in all the writers ſince the reformation, put together. One ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the catholik ground and autority; another rejects and villifies it; another accepts the words, but by ſome trope or other turns the ſens; another allows the natural ſens, but ſayes it is one of his errours; another will not have that, nor any other authority upon earth, to be of any force in thoſe affairs, &amp;c. And thus they do about every particular of antient faith; ſtill laughing, and hugging one anothers fancies, though never ſo much contradictory, as well to one another, as to the common faith they all impugn.</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange confuſion would this caus in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57771:62"/>the world, if the like proceeding were counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in civil, as here in ſpiritual affairs; and men might be outed of their eſtates and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by half a ſcore witty lawyers, with cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning querks and ſubtle ſophiſtries deluding his right and tenure, no judg admitted to give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And indeed although this conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in ſpiritual affairs, yet it ever ends in civil. When they have once outed a Land of their old religion, and the proſperity and peace attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, mens perſons, eſtates, dignities, nay the very laws of the Land are apprehended, and brought into the power of theſe reformers, to the utter deſolation of a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And as this book of <hi>Whitbies,</hi> Sir, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious mirrour of all Anticatholiks dealing with the old Roman faith; ſo will I give you in civil affairs a perfect emblem of all <hi>Whitbies</hi> book: That all may clearly ſee, if this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding be allowable, what confuſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice muſt needs follow.</p>
            <p>The Emblem of the old Roman religion I make <hi>Caius</hi> the ſeventeenth Knight, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of his family, which hath continued in the ſtate time out of mind. A faction riſes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him of all that he and his anceſtours had ſo long and peaceably enjoyed. They tell him in general, that his anceſtors were intruders: but differ very much about the time, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion was firſt made. One ſayes 200 year ago,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57771:62"/>another 800, another 500, ſeveral men, ſeveral wayes, and cannot agree. They com at laſt to his own particular title. <hi>Caius</hi> ſhews his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſucceſſion legally deſcending, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſing for ſo many generations; and an evident teſtament alſo for himſelf, wherin it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Ego Gonvillus, &amp;c. conſtituo Caium filium meum heredem bonorum meorum omnium, &amp;c. I Gonvil do conſtitute my ſon Caius heir of all my goods, &amp;c.</hi> The adverſaries, put caſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier, Dally, Pleſſis, Blondel, Baxter, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Hall, &amp;c. laugh at this, and tell him it is all impertinent, and proves nothing.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Alas quoth <hi>Chamier,</hi> theſe words are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted. It was not written <hi>Caium</hi> but <hi>Saium:</hi> And the corruption is eaſie, only the bottom of the firſt letter being razed out.</item>
               <item>2. Let it be as you will, quoth <hi>Dally,</hi> this teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be of no value. For it proceeds upon an uncertain, if not fals, ſuppoſition. Who can ſay aſſuredly, that either you are his ſon <hi>Caius,</hi> or that <hi>Caius</hi> is indeed his ſon.</item>
               <item>3. Either, quoth Chillingworth, you muſt be his ſon and actual heir, while he was alive, or when he was dead. Not while he was alive; for the right can be but in one at once: Not when he was dead, for no man can be a ſon to one that is not; no more then any perſon that is alive, can be a father to one that has no being.</item>
               <item>4. Were this right, quoth Baxter, which is conveighed to you, in your
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57771:63"/>father only, or in ſom others alſo beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? If in himſelf alone, why doth he ſay <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituo,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>ſimul ſtatuo,</hi> or I appoint together with others.</item>
               <item>5. It ſeems to me, quoth <hi>Blondel,</hi> that this teſtament, Mr <hi>Caius</hi> is rather againſt, then with you. Either you pretend to be his ſon, before his teſtament was made, or after. If before, your own evidence witneſſes againſt you; <hi>Conſtituo Caium filium meum,</hi> I make Caius my ſon. If after; then by this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament you are made his ſon, but ſuppoſed only an heir: and a title for that here is none at all.</item>

And can you think Mr. <hi>Caius,</hi> that a dying man would ſpeak impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly? ſurely no. The goods of the mind, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, prudence, temperance, theſe, as Ariſtotle witneſſes, are <hi>proprie bona,</hi> properly are only to be called goods: But the goods of the body, and goods of fortune, theſe are improperly and falſſy ſo called.</item>
               <item>7. Let it be what kind of goods you will, quoth <hi>Hall,</hi> this very word <hi>meorum,</hi> Mr. Caius, quite overthrows all your pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe are your fathers words you ſay; well then, if it be ſo, either the ſtate you plead for is now his, or now not his. If it be now his, then it is not yours; if it be now not his, then the very title you rely upon is fals.</item>

Out of his own mouth I will condemn him, and with the very firſt word of his will he ſayes his father made, which is <hi>Ego.</hi> For it is clear enough, that <hi>Ego</hi> is the firſt perſon, and not the laſt. And all theſe are uſhered in by a young Whitby. <hi>To this hath Chamier told you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Can you not ſee what incomparable Chillingworth hath taught you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You will ſtill be impertinent, though learned Pleſsis hath informed you, that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where were your eyes, when great Dally hath told you, that,</hi> &amp;c.</item>

            <p>In theſe few words Sir, I have given you a clear Emblem, not only of this book of Mr. Whitbies, but of all the writings have been made againſt catholik religion, ſince the reformation. Ther is no evidence ſo clear for that antient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but it is endeavoured ſeveral wayes to be made fruſtrate: Although unto Catholiks, who underſtand their religion, thoſe evaſions ſignifie no more then theſe I have ſpecified,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57771:64"/>againſt a title moſt irrefragable and firm. Yet in that conteſt children and unexperienced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would judg poor <hi>Caius</hi> to be utterly loſt. And ſo indeed he will, if thoſe crafty Lawyers may determin the buſines without recours to any Judg: as is don in all our affairs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of religion. How many ſophiſtical evaſions is he to anſwer about one and the ſame thing? How many captious ſnares to incur, in any one of his anſwers? to be overwhelmed without doubt, while no Judg interpoſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their multitude of words, or force of arms. But enough of this, which indeed can never be too much thought of.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> Sir, begins and ends his book juſt as you begin and end yours, againſt which he writes. For as you in the concluſion of your book ſet down ſom rules, which you deſire him that ſhall reply unto it, for more clearnes and order, and ſubſtantiallity of diſcours, to obſerv; ſo <hi>Whitby</hi> in the end of this his reply againſt your book, wherin he hath not heeded to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv ſo much as any one of thoſe your good rules, does alſo preſcribe laws for you, if you mean to anſwer him again, wherof the firſt is, <hi>That you conſider all the anſwers he hath given to any of your arguments: and that otherwis, if any one ſingle anſwer remain, your agument muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,</hi> p. 501. This is the firſt and wittieſt of his conditions. For the ſeveral ſhifts and evaſions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57771:64"/>of above twenty men, which he makes uſe of, about moſt of the ſubſtantial points of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, being all put together and multiplied, as they be, to ſom thouſands, would, if they ſhould be all ſpoken to in particular, though never ſo briefly, rais ſuch a bulk of a book, as hath been ſeldom ſeen, and would never be read. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I have already told you, contradictory one to another, and ten to one exceſſively chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, would no leſs diſable the repute and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of that man, who ſhould ſo much as take notice of them, then to play with boyes at ſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>And as he ends his book with the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preſcribing laws, as you concluded yours; ſo doth he begin his in the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame words as you enter yours. <hi>I cannot forbid my ſelf to wonder that,</hi> &amp;c. So begins your book. <hi>I cannot forbid my ſelf to wonder that,</hi> &amp;c. ſo begins this book of his, which he writes againſt you, imitating and repeating your very words for many lines together, and returning them hand over head upon your ſelf, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our good women of Billingſgate, not caring, ſo he ſay again what you ſpeak, how true or fals, juſt or unjuſt his words be.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general, I ſhall ſay more by and by, after I have briefly told you, what he does in each particular chapter of his book.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57771:65"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>His firſt ch. from page</hi> 1 <hi>to</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Is a bitter invective againſt Papiſts, whom he concludes for their cruelties and diſloyalty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of mercy or any affection. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges indeed, that <hi>Catholik religion cannot ſtand juſtly charged with any ſuch crimes,</hi> p. 2. But yet he layes the crimes upon them all notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo indefinitely, and only upon them, that he excludes univerſally all profeſſours of that religion, and them alone, from all compaſſion and love: Although he knows in his heart, both that the religion, the very religion of ſom others in this land, ſtands juſtly charged with thoſe crimes, whereof he acknowledges catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik religion free; and that Papiſts alſo or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiks, are the only men, that have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally exhibited themſelvs unblamable, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that breaſt of love and mercy, from whence he would have them all excluded.</p>
            <p>And to make theſe Papiſts odious, he names ſom wars and troubles of theirs in Ireland, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Bohemia, Savoy. Indeed he needed not have wandred ſo far as Bohemia or Poland. The ſtory of our own England would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a large volum of matter, if all that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have ever don muſt be attributed to their religion, for wars and broils enough to tire a reader. How many battles have there been here between the Scot and Engliſh, between the Sax and Norman, between the Norman and Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57771:65"/>between the Engliſh and French at Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, and all over France, with much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſlaughter; between the two houſes of York and Lancaſter at home, when all theſe parties were Papiſts, and no other religion known amongſt them. Is there no other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to attribute all theſe diſorders unto, but that religion, which endeavours, as much as it is able, to ſtifle all theſe evil fruits of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence amongſt men; which ſom time or other will ſhoot up, notwithſtanding all the heavenly endeavour of that divine ſeed, implanted in men on purpos to ſuppres it. Muſt or can Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants be juſtly charged, with the treaſons, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, robberies of all ſuch as have been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in our Jayls, or hanged at Tyburn, ſince the reformation? And yet thus we deal with poor Catholiks, to adde affliction upon affliction, and extinguiſh that ſmall ſparkle of life which is left in their bodies.</p>
            <p>It is ſurely a general fault in Proteſtants, that we think in our hearts, whatever we ſpeak outwardly, that Roman catholiks are, as they ſhould be, all Saints, all ſpotles in their lives, all of them unblamable, univerſally unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And hence it is, that if ever we diſcover one traytor, fool, or knave amongſt any of that profeſſion, we exult and make bonefires for joy, and record it in our books one age after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that all the world may know, and ever
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57771:66"/>remember, that even ſom of them have been tranſgreſſors. We do not wonder ſo at our own Proteſtants, though thouſands of them ſhould prove traytors together and many are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hanged, and ſom alſo burnt for their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crimes. I am ſure the Papiſts have not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, any ſuch opinion of men of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they ſhould ſo neceſſarily be honeſt and good, as that it is impoſſible any ſhould be otherwis. But even in catholik countreys, they have their whips and ſtocks, and gibbets and priſons, and torturs, provided for malefactors, as well as we have here. And Princes will there go to wars, as well as we. Did not the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> do ſo? And the people too think themſelvs bound, even by their religion, to follow them. Nor have any people roſe in rebellious herds, to do miſchief, but they would ſomtimes pretend religion for it, although they act indeed againſt the dictamen not only of other mens religion, but perhaps their own too. Catholiks know their religion is good, and pure and holy, and apt to make all men ſo, that walk according to its direction. But if any ſwerv, they pitty indeed, and pray for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance; but they wonder not, as we do at it; much leſs do they rejoyce, when any of our Proteſtants are taken and hanged for treaſon; nor do they write, or ſpread it abroad in books, nor make bonefires, or keep holy-dayes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57771:66"/>for joy of a thing, which is indeed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their grief and pitty.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> ſpeaks here ſo much of <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> and <hi>mental reſervations,</hi> as proper and peculiar only unto Papiſts, which render them, although they ſhould promis and ſwear allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance never ſo ſeriouſly, not at all to be beleeved or truſted; that I began to doubt, whether all London, and the whole Land, may not haply be Papiſts, although I thought not of it. One thing I am ſure of, and all men are of my mind, that when we go into a ſhop in London, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any market or fair in England to buy wares, when they tell us, yea and ſwear too, that the thing we cheapen coſt them ſo much out of their own purſe, we do not beleev a word they ſay, but think they have either ſom reſervation in their mind, or uſe an equivocation or ly. And even Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> himſelf, muſt either be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt too, if mental reſervation be peculiar only unto them, when he ſayes ſo often in his book, of which I treat, <hi>That there is not one reaſon in Mr. Creſſeys book that is pertinent, not one autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but corrupted, not one inſtance but uſhered in with diſadvantages to the truth, and forgery:</hi> or if he be not a Papiſt, he muſt in theſe and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other paſſages in this his book, wherin he either ſecretly equivocates, or openly lyes, at leaſt <hi>papiſtare,</hi> and act that, which he ſayes only Papiſts practice.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57771:67"/>
            <p> To give one example, he ſayes p. 237. <hi>That one general councel calls the reſpect given to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a hundred times by the name of worſhip.</hi> I have good reaſon to think, that one Councel would not uſe that word much above fourſcore times, if they be rightly numbred. So likewiſe he ſayes here p. 4. <hi>That the whole colledg of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in London ſaid, that they would rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the late Kings ruin then hinder it, leſt the Puritans ſhould make uſe of his diſtreſſes to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> o too too fooliſh and malicious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny! For ſurely, this is ſomthing more then an equivocation. They rather promote then hinder it! How could they do either the one or the other? Thus ſom of our mad countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not aſhamed to tell it abroad, about ten years ago, even in catholik countreys where they travelled, that they who ſate in Court, and condemned our gracious King, were moſt of them Papiſts and Jeſuits. And did all the whole colledg of Jeſuits in London conclude this, ſo generally, that there was not any one againſt it? Who took the votes, that he could be ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this great ſcret? And where is this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Jeſuits in London? Who ever heard of any ſuch thing? Will ever any of this wild talk paſs for other, then the dream of a man in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam? We ſhall ere long be frighted by ſuch as <hi>Whithy</hi> and <hi>Baxter,</hi> from hanging our pot over the fire, leſt the whole colledg of Jeſuits in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57771:67"/>moon, ſhould conſpire together, to water down upon our heads, and ſpoil our pottage. They would never tell us theſe things, or hope to be beleeved, were not the opinion they hav of our reaſon as ſmall, as the confidence they hav of their own audacity is great? And what will the colledg, the whole colledg of Jeſuits here in London determin next? If they ſhould chance to decree, that no whale, or cod or her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhould ever com into the North ſeas, as now it is not unlikely they may, they will undo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a family.</p>
            <p>In the end of this his firſt chapter, are cited ſom Councils ſeverity againſt heretiks, wherin Mr <hi>Whitby</hi> thinks himſelf concerned with much regret and anger. <hi>One of theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was kept at Lateran, the other at Leyden under Pope Innocent.</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>concilium Lateranum</hi> is the councel he ſayes was kept at Lateran: though his Dictionary of proper words will not help him to underſtand, in what countrey that town of Lateran is to be found. And <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Lugdunenſe</hi> is that which he engliſhes the councel of Leyden; all the hiſtory and reading Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> has, not been able to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Ludunum Batavorum,</hi> and <hi>Lugdunum in Gallia;</hi> betwixt Leyden in Holland, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any councel was kept, and Lyons in France, where Pope Innocent held that councel, whilſt he ſojourned in Burgundy. But though he be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57771:68"/>yet but raw, you ſhall find him a greater profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by and by.</p>
            <p>As for that councel of Lateran, wherin is a confiſcation of goods and other penalties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, upon ſuch as run into diſturbing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; it touched only exteriour diſciplin or temporal ſtatutes, and no article or buſines of religion. Nor did the Church make any ſuch conſtitution by her own autority, but declared only, what ſecular power may juſtly do, when they think it expedient and neceſſary, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent further evils. What power have Prieſts and Byſhops over mens eſtates and lives? But the Emperour and Kings were willing to have it ſo ordained in that venerable aſſembly; that with a more plauſible colour they might be able to provide for their Kingdoms peace, even in thoſe affairs which they themſelvs were to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, though not to determin. Nor does any King in Chriſtendom think himſelf any further obliged by that decree, to put ſuch laws in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, then he ſhall with his privat councel think fit. And all ſecular princes, will by the advice of their peers proceed to ſuch penalties, when they pleas, whether any ſynod decree it or no. Nor is it the wors, if a councel do ſay that in ſom caſes may be don, which princes in their diſcretion think expedient.</p>

               <hi>His</hi> 2 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 7 <hi>to</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Tells us, that Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> is here in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57771:68"/>ſweat, good Sir, for your faults. <hi>I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to conſider that our Author ſhould be ſo imprudent to ſay no wors, to call God to witneſs to his ſoul, that he hath ſtudiouſly avoided all cavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtortion of texts, &amp;c.</hi> And then he addes with a new fervour, That <hi>all Fathers are miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably corrupted by you, and allegations moſt diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly forged.</hi> And <hi>if it be not ſo,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I will forfeit preſently my life.</hi> Good man, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages very far, as you ſee, for you. He will dy, dy preſently; if Fathers, all the Fathers, be not corrupted, miſerably corrupted, by you. And this he will do without any trembling, if he do not make that good which he trembles to think of. But it is no wondrous matter I think, to hear him utter ſuch daring words, although he uſe here none of his mental reſervations. he knows himſelf as ſafe as a thief in a mill; and that it will never be put to a Jury, to find whether he be guilty or no.</p>
            <p>His firſt chapter was fuming wrath; this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a ſhivering fear: And ſo he proceeds, from one paſſion to another, quite through his book, even to the end, to verifie his own words in his Epiſtle to his Patron, where upon the ſight of your book, he ſaith, that <hi>he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put into ſuch a paſsion, as vented it ſelf into this reply.</hi> But theſe paſſious of his, and the various vilifications both of your book and perſon, wherewith this reply of his, and aſſault againſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57771:69"/>Catholiks is ſtuft, or any other of his calumnies and bitter invectives againſt Papiſts, which are many and hainous. I ſhall not trouble you with now. You muſt have patience, and let them paſs, as other good people do, where ever you meet them. Miniſters, good men, fight for their wives and children, either thoſe they have or hope to have, which will be undon and loſt, if the odium of Popery, and of all ſuch as any way excuſe and defend their innocence, be not ſmartly kept up. My adverſary OeN did as much to innocent <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which had no other fault, but that it had excuſed the faultles. To do well and hear ill, this muſt be the lot, as that is the endeavour of all good men in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his</hi> 3 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 9. <hi>to</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>The challenge of Biſhop Jewel for the firſt 600 years againſt Papiſts, which all his graver brethren diſliked, Mr. Whitby, if his word here be of any worth, will make it good, yea and enlarge it with Perkins, White, Baxter, and Crackanthorp to 800, yea 1200 years, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was not,</hi> they ſay, <hi>any ſuch creatur as a Papiſt in the world.</hi> And he cares not a pin, though Beza, Melancton, and Luther, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to the contrary, that Popery hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Antiquity, before all other waies. <hi>Beza,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and Melancton are ſtrangers to us. Muſt we be accountable for Luthers words?</hi> And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57771:69"/>yet all over his book, he makes more uſe of ſtrangers, &amp; gives more credit to them, then any of our own, and would have us do ſo too. Are not Chamier, Dally, Pleſſis, Grotius, Blondel, as much ſtrangers, and of as little credit, as Beza, Melancton, and Luther. But what if our own Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſpeaks for the Papiſts antiquity above others? What i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our own <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſay, that to beleev by the teſtimony of the Church, is the very hereſie of the Papiſts? O then his anſwer is ready at hand. <hi>What is all this to the purpos? did ever any Proteſtant ſay otherwis? do they therfor confeſs their antiquity?</hi> The ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fears no colours. If any or many both of our own and forreign Proteſtants do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Papiſts antiquity, why, what then? If ſome deny it, then it is ſo. It is as they ſay, who ſay as he ſayes. And if any ſay otherwiſe, it is otherwiſe. It is not ſo.</p>
            <p>Ther is one aſſertion in this his third chapter, that deſervs I think to be written in capital let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For p. 16. having told you Sir, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants either affront the evidence of Scripture againſt Fapiſts, or the intent of the Apoſtles, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> he thinks therfor, that Proteſtants rejection of Popery may well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and <hi>eſpecially,</hi> ſaith he, (theſe are his words ſo much remarkable) <hi>When you Papiſts know, we hold that in all matters of faith, it is all one withus, to be praeter Scripturam, and to be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57771:70"/>contra.</hi> That is, in plain Engliſh, what is not in Scripture, that Proteſtants hold to be againſt it. And is this ſo?</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is hard to ſay, how far matters of faith reach. Ther is one ſort of people now in England, that would have all things acted and diſpoſed even in civil affairs, only according to the tenour of Goſpel. And what is beſide it, they conclude by this very axiom to be againſt it. And ſo they decry all our Courts, our very Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace and Conſtables. But in eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical affairs, the proper buſineſſes of the Church, and matters of religion, as diſtinct from civil, this is the plea which the good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers uſe againſt the Byſhops and Prieſts, of not only the Roman, but even this our Engliſh Church, which Whitby defends. Why, ſay they to them, why are we harraſſed, impriſoned, beaten and ſpoiled ſo many wayes, by your inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who have made your ſelves drank with the blood of Saints? Do not we either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the evidence of Scriptur againſt you, or the intent of the Apoſtles, or rather of God himſelf, and tell you expreſly, that you oppoſe the evidence of Gods word, in your obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ordinations, in your tythes and Lents, and Maſs-tides, in your lawn ſleeves and caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocks and canonical girdles, in your Pulpits, Univerſities, and Steeple-houſes, in your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deanaries, in your orders and degrees,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57771:70"/>in your oppreſſions of conſcience and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in your ſurplices, copes, and preaching for hire, &amp;c. Is it not enough to ſhew our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, in not accepting theſe things, becaus in the beginning it was not ſo? nor were any of theſe things to be found amongſt the apoſtles. Eſpecially when you know, we hold, and we know alſo you hold, that in matters of faith and religion, it is all one, to be beſide Scriptur, and to be againſt it. Are your Chapters and Deanaries, your lawn ſleeves and ſurplices, your Lents and common-prayers, your tythes and livings of five or ſix hundred a year, your univerſities, and ſteeple-houſes in Scriptur and Chriſtian Goſpel, yea or no? If they be there, ſhew it us. If they are beſides ſcriptur or not in it, then are they by your own confeſſion here, againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ch.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>from p.</hi> 17. <hi>to</hi> 90.</p>
            <p>Theſe five following chapters ſpeak againſt <hi>eccleſiaſtical Supremacy,</hi> either amongſt the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or any other ſucceeding prelates. And with ſo much earneſtnes and little heed doth Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> whiff away all your defence of it, that he ſtrikes off that authority, not only from the Popes head, but from any Prince or Prelate whatſoever; not caring ſo the Roman fall, if the Engliſh Prelacy ſink too. So earneſt indeed is he bent againſt it that he profeſſes p. 39. <hi>he would ſooner perſwade himſelf of the truth of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57771:71"/>fables, then any ſuch pretenſion.</hi> Thus well is he diſpoſed againſt the coming of the Turk.</p>
            <p>Theſe few propoſitions he advances here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others. 1. <hi>That the apoſtles had an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of power and juriſdiction or dignity over the reſt.</hi> But whence then comes our Engliſh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, of byſhops, arch-byſhops, miniſters, and deacons? Whitby himſelf denies, that our Kings are the root of Epiſcopal juriſdiction here in England; <hi>Who ever thought ſo,</hi> quoth he, p. 88. I think I could ſhow him out of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and laws of the Land, that our Engliſh Epiſcopacy, and their whole juriſdiction, is from the King, as the ſole fountain and root of it. But if it be not ſo; and no ſuch ſubordination, as here he affirms, was ever found amongſt the apoſtles, whence is our Engliſh Hierarchy? If it neither come from God nor from the King, it may not irrationally be ſuſpected, to be from an inſufficient if not an ill original.</p>
            <p>His ſecond is, <hi>that ſuch an eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is uſeles, and unable to prevent ſchiſmes, whether they riſe from breach of charity or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of judgement,</hi> p. 20. And if it be uſeles for that, for Gods ſake what is it good for? Third is, <hi>that to ſubmit to one, is to ſlight the judgment of thouſands, that may be as wiſe as he; and to endanger the very being of religion. Ibid.</hi> And is it ſo indeed? why then are ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions here in <hi>England</hi> ſubjected to one Byſhop,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57771:71"/>much people to one miniſter, all the people, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and byſhops to one King? Is this to ſlight all that are ſubjected, or to endanger the very being of religion. Fourth is, that <hi>general cauſes cannot be diſpatched by one ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour over all, as may particular by inferiour ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents.</hi> And other ſuch like fanatick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions he has; which do as much evacuate the ſubordination of our Engliſh as the Roman Church, and civil government as well as eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hierarchy. I am ſure they have done both, even in this our Kingdom, and in our own dayes: a thing which will not be ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And little did I think to ſee any prelatick miniſter broach ſuch whimſies again here in our land, ſo lately made deſolate thereby. What he means by it I cannot tell. But I am ſure he is not ſo unadviſed, but he underſtands the conſequence. For p. 423. upon his grant of a liberty of judging to particular perſons, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion; whence all our wars and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities here in <hi>England</hi> do firſt flow, even ſo far as to deny obedience therupon to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſuperiours, he ſpeaks thus: <hi>Would a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King, think you, preſently condemn all thoſe to the utmoſt ſeverity, who in ſuch caſes after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation and deliberation duly made, by reaſon of ſom prejudices or weaknes of reaſoning, ſhould be induced to think it their duty to follow the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous party?</hi> he craftily uſes the phraſe of <hi>utmoſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57771:72"/>ſeverity,</hi> the better to palliate his more ſecret judgment, who by his own principles here and elſewhere not obſcurely expreſſed, muſt needs conceiv them liable to no ſeverity at all.</p>
            <p>But that you may ſee, Sir, this adverſary of yours, what a lively ſpark he is, he makes in his 5 chapter the very Popes themſelvs, when ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly they would expreſs their own ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either to ſay nothing for it, or altogether againſt it. If Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> ſpeak of his own ſolicitude over the Churches of God, even to the utmoſt bounds of the ocean. Whitby hence infers, that <hi>his headſhip therfor is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, becaus it is bounded.</hi> Is not this witty? And thus the great Prophet, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the vaſte unlinited extent of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias his dominion <hi>(dominabitur à mari uſque ad mare, &amp; à flumine uſque ad terminos orbis terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi> muſt be underſtood to limit and confine it.</p>
            <p>Again, if Pope <hi>Julius</hi> defend his acts of power and juriſdiction, by ancient cannons and cuſtom; Whitby concludes from thence, that <hi>it is not therfor of divine inſtitution; for cuſtom and cannons are but humane.</hi> Witty ſtill. Thus a maſter, when ſending his ſervant on an errand, he tells him he may well go, for that he gave him lately a pair of new ſhooes, loſes therby all his other claim of commanding him.</p>
            <p>Again, if St. <hi>Gregory</hi> prefer the Apoſtolicall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57771:72"/>See before other Churches. <hi>That is,</hi> quoth Whitby, <hi>not for it ſelf, but for the Emperours ſeat.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon muſt the Byſhop of London or Abbot of Weſtminſter, if any now were, be preferred before the Byſhop of Canterbury.</p>
            <p>If Pope <hi>Leo</hi> derive his autority from St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prince of the apoſtles, <hi>That may infer,</hi> quoth he, a <hi>precedency of order, but not any dignity.</hi> A Prince, it ſeems, ſignifies only one that is to go before, not one, that has any dignity or power to command thoſe that follow after. Thus will your adverſary put authorities into his mouth, and draw them in an inſtant, moſt nimbly out of his throat, without ever touching his ſtomack. Can we think him unable, by ſuch Hugonot evaſions, to whiff away all the four goſpels and apoſtles creed, as to its former ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if there ſhould once be a neceſſity urging him to ſubmit to Mahomets fables, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them and his creed together? Who dare ſay he cannot do it, and do it as wiſely too, as perhaps he ever did thing in his life.</p>
            <p>I think it not amiſs Sir, to give you yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further taſte here of our Author; your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries nimblenes, only ſom little of much; for I mean to be very breef.</p>
            <p>Doth emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> eſtabliſh, that whatſoever is decreed by the See apoſtolik, which is raiſed upon the merits of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:57771:73"/>dignity of the city, and authority of councels, ſhould have the force of a law to all Byſhops? <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>was a young man and eaſily ſeduced. What doth this conclude for the Popes ſupremacy,</hi> &amp;c. The laws then of Kings and Emperours are to be weighed, it ſeems, by the age of the law-maker. And if he ſhould be a young man, they ſignifie nothing againſt any delinquent or tranſgreſſour, if he have but the wit to plead here with <hi>Whitby,</hi> that the King was young, when that law was made. This ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeduced young mans law was in force not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in following times, and put into the code by the old mature grave man, and not eaſily ſeduced Emperour Juſtinian: And no man either young or old ever excepted againſt it, for the youth of the legiſlator. Young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not make laws as boyes tell tales, only by ſtrength of their own wits. Valentinian was a young man, and his laws therfor, according to Whitby, not to be regarded: And what then ſhall we think of our Engliſh proteſtancy, which was here firſt publikly ſet up by King Edward the ſixt, a child.</p>
            <p>Doth an eccleſiaſtical cannon ſay, that no decree can be eſtabliſhed in the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſent of the Roman byſhop. <hi>That is,</hi> quoth Whitby, <hi>except the Roman Byſhop be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. What doth this make for ſupremacy? &amp;c.</hi> But if he have no autority there, why may he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57771:73"/>not as well be abſent. There is no certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber required for the making of a decree: and that byſhop does no more, it ſeems, then make up a number.</p>
            <p>Doth the councel of Epheſus refer the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patriarch of Antioch his caus to the Pope? for that the Church of Antioch had been ever governed by the Roman. <hi>That was,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>not to uſe his autority, but only to know his mind, &amp;c.</hi> And what matters it, I pray, what his mind may be, if the others never mean to heed it. We conſult any that are preſem, whether equal or inferiours, to know their minds, and yet do our ſelves what we liſt: but we never trouble men a thouſand miles off for that. Surely when a judgment is referred by parties to another power ſo far diſtant, with great expence and long expectation, and only upon this ground, that they are ſubject, and have ever been governed by that power, they cannot be thought only to require his mind, but uſe his authority. Our honeſt Quaker will not be unwilling thus to have his caus referred to the judgment of our Engliſh Biſhops; not to uſe their authorities, but only to know their minds.</p>
            <p>Doth the Sardican councel ordain, that in a controverſie between byſhops, Appeal ſhould be made to the Byſhop of Rome, to appoint Judges, and renew the proces. <hi>That cannon,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:57771:74"/>ſayes he, <hi>is againſt the Papiſts; for it permits the Pope to receiv, not to command appeals, &amp;c.</hi> So then: Papiſts, it ſeems, think the Pope may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not receiv appeals. <hi>And beſides,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the appellation was there ordained ad Julium Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum, not ad Papam Romanum: Not to the Pope who then was Julius; but to Julius who then was Pope.</hi> We have here ſurely another Hudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras; <hi>In logick a great critick, profoundly skilled in Analytick; he can diſtinguiſh and divide a hair twixt South and South-Weſt ſide.</hi> Appeal to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pope, not to Pope Julius! And what does he think to gain by this ſubtilty? The cannon he hopes will ceas forſooth, when Julius dies. O the wit of ſome men above other ſome, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is aſſiſted by French Hugonots who drink good wine. Our Engliſh ale could never have made us out ſo ſubtil a diſtinction as this is.</p>
            <p>Doth the councel of <hi>Arles</hi> ſend their decrees to the Byſhop of Rome, from whom all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to receiv what to beleev and practis? <hi>Here is ſomthing of trouble,</hi> quoth Whitby, <hi>but nothing of juriſdiction in the Pope, &amp;c.</hi> Can any thing hang more tight then this? Conciliar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees muſt be ſent to Rome, from whence all Chriſtians muſt receiv what they are either to beleev or practis. But this is not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his power, but to trouble his patience.</p>
            <p>Doth St. Baſil ſay, it is convenient to write
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57771:74"/>to the byſhop of Rome to conclude affairs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and to paſs his ſentence? <hi>O,</hi> quoth he, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>doth not ſignifie to give ſentence, but advice.</hi> Here you have a ſpice of his grammer to mix with his logick; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Doth Athanaſius fly to Rome againſt the Euſebians, and Pope Julius appoint a day in his behalf <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for plea and judgment, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, following therein the law and method of the Church. <hi>He followed that law,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>not in citing them, but in not condemning them uncited. &amp;c.</hi> He was juſt then, in not condemning parties uncited. But by what authority he either cited or judged them, we muſt not here know. Is ther any law of the Church, that juſtifies a condemnation of perſons cited to judgment, when they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cited nor judged by any legal autority? And it is to be obſerved here, Sir, all this while, and quite through his book, that Whitby has forgot the fearful execration he made upon himſelf in the beginning, <hi>that all fathers are miſerably corrupted by you, and allegations moſt diſingeniouſly forged, &amp;c.</hi> This I ſay he has quite forgot, even ſo far forgot, that there is not one autority in a hundred, that he does ſo much as challenge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of forgery or corruption. And is therfor in danger to forfeit preſently his life. But he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57771:75"/>was then in his own heat, now he is amongſt his Proteſtant authors, who afford him other kind of evaſions. And we muſt leav him to their wits, when he has loſt his own memory.</p>
            <p>Doth S. Auguſtin witnes, that the caus of the Donatiſts in Africa was judged by Pope Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiades in Rome. <hi>This was,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>a brotherly, not an authorative deciſion.</hi> I make no doubt it was brotherly, but why not authora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? Mr. Whitby hath ſeen perhaps ſom elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cockerel, to part the frayes of younger chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens; and thinks tribunals of byſhops do no more. The Pope, it ſeems, was ever a loving brother at leaſt, ſtill ready to decide the frayes of all Churches and Byſhops upon all occaſions; which was a pious and good work, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Antichriſt. He would do well Sir, to part this fray of yours with Mr. Whitby, which otherwis will never be ended.</p>
            <p>Is the Roman Patriarch ſaid, to have the care of all the Churches? <hi>Any one,</hi> ſaith Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>may have that repute; for he that ſerves one Church ſerves all.</hi> And if Whitby get but the cure of any one little Chappel here in England, though it be but to read prayers in an hoſpital, he muſt then be beleeved to have the ſolicitude of all the Engliſh Churches upon him.</p>
            <p>In brief, doth S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> to declare a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy among the apoſtles, affirm, that St. James obtained the throne of Jeruſalem, but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57771:75"/>St. Peter was conſtituted maſter and teacher, not of one throne, but of the whole world, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That text,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is in all likelihood by negligence of tranſcribers, or ſom other way, miſtaken. However it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for ſupremacy: were not all the apoſtles ſo?</hi> He gathers they were all ſo, becaus the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity of the title, <hi>maſter and teacher of the whole world,</hi> is there attributed unto one, excluſively to all the reſt. Every miniſter is a byſhop or overſeer, if we mind only the ſignification of the word, but is he therfor ſo in the whole meaning and peculiarity of the title?</p>
            <p>Finally, doth our Mr. Whitgift acknowledg, that the apoſtles were all equal as to their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not as to government; equal <hi>quoad mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium,</hi> not <hi>quoad polititiam;</hi> which is a plain and manifeſt aſſertion, Sir, of the ſupremacy you plead for? <hi>What is this,</hi> ſaith Whitby <hi>to the purpos?</hi> He findes never a word in that ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> which begins with s. u. p. and therfor cries out, What is this to the purpos? what is this to ſupremacy?</p>
            <p>You muſt not expect, Sir, that in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding chapters, I ſhould give you any more account of the particular quickneſſes of your adverſary. They are all like theſe which I have here briefly hinted to you in this firſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted point of Supremacy; only that you may ſee, that he, or the ſeveral champions rather,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57771:76"/>which he makes uſe of, have more diſtinctions than one. But by ſuch evaſions, diſtinctions, and ſhifts, wherewith moſt men are now made ſo acquainted, that they can uſe them nimbly againſt any laws and authorities either divine or humane, are the people of our diſtreſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom carried up and down, like a cork in water, or goſſimor in the air, with every wind and billow of a fancy, now here, now there, being removed once from their ancient ſtability, unto endles diſquiet. Cannot a man in this manner and method, evacuate, ſlight, and fruſtrate every thing? What authority, law, or cuſtom, either human or divine, can ſtand in force, if it may be thus by Whitbean Sophomoriſmes laughed out of countenance? I will be bold to ſay, that the witty Presbyterian does more ſubſtantially refute all prelatick principles and practices, then theſe anſwer the Roman. Nay theſe in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roman, have made way for the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian: And yet they will ſtill be ſcribling.</p>
            <p>But you muſt know Sir withall, that Mr. Whitby in his intervals or cooler moods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Roman Patriarch, a priority of order and honour, although he will not afford him any autority or juriſdiction. A <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſeat he ſhall have, although no ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy or power. For he ſayes p. 52. <hi>The byſhop of Rome was to do it,</hi> (judg cauſes he means, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv appeals, and the like) <hi>more eſpecially for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57771:76"/>the dignity of his ſeat, which made him prime in order or Byſhops.</hi> And again p. 66. <hi>St. Baſil calling the Byſhop of Rome</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the head or apex of Weſtern Byſhops, makes him only,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the chief in order, and moſt eminent Byſhop of the Weſt, which title we can very well allow him.</hi> So that the Pope, if he ſhould come hither to us, either for love or hoſpitality, although our byſhops will not allow him authoratively to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, keep chapter, make laws, or puniſh any of them for tranſgreſſing the eccleſiaſtical can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, yet will they give him a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and ſuffer him, if Mr. Whitby be any legal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ceremonies, to ſit at the upper end of the table. And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it ſeems, had no more. Nor had he any power, ſo much as to command any man to riſe from the table, if he behaved himſelf unmannerly at his meat.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a precedency he allows his own chief Superiour, the Arch-byſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; and no more. <hi>A Metropolitan,</hi> ſaith he, p. 23. <hi>hath no juriſdiction over byſhops: He can do nothing, &amp;c.</hi> And again page 33. <hi>His grace of Canterbury hath no power of juriſdiction over by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi> And this he ſpeaks boldly; although he aſſert withall, that a byſhop hath juriſdiction over pariſh-prieſts, and theſe over their pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. So that according to Whitby, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, dignity, and power which is in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, muſt be wanting in the higheſt degree of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57771:77"/>hierarchy; which muſt, if this be true, end with power, and begin with feeblenes; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both to common reaſon, and that famous ſpeech of learned Porphyry, <hi>In ſummis eſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas cum virtute, in infimis multitudo cum debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi> Mr. Whitby has no hope perhaps ever to be made Metropolitan, although he may poſſibly ſee himſelf a byſhop; and will not therfor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt himſelf aforehand, of the dignity he may one time or other arrive at, although the for call the grapes, he has no hopes to reach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory and ſowre ſtuff.</p>
            <p>But his grace of Canterbury, hath he no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, Mr. Whitby, over byſhops? What law, cuſtom, or tradition gives byſhops a power over pariſh-prieſts, which allows not a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan as much over byſhops? And if he have only a precedency of place, then can theſe have no more: And it is as eaſie to ſay the one, as the other. And is all our hierarchy com only to a precedency of honour? Here will be fine work for a Quaker, who will as reſolutely deny the honour, as you the power. How coms that eminent perſon to be ſtiled his <hi>grace of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> but only for his power, dignity, and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the venerable byſhops? And this power and dignity hath, I am ſure, belonged to the See of Canterbury ever ſince the firſt planting of Chriſtianity among the Engliſh, which inables that byſhop to make laws, to viſit
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57771:77"/>his province, to call together his byſhops, to cenſure, to puniſh even Prelates themſelves, if they tranſgreſs the cannons: which is as much as any byſhop can do to his pariſh prieſts. Is it not a ſtrange preſumption in a young man, thus to diſable his own chief prelate before his face, and ſay peremptorily, that a Metropolitan can do nothing; that his grace of Canterbury hath no juriſdiction. I know, and am fully aſſured, ther is not one of thoſe poor catholik prieſts who were lately baniſhed out of England, but would have defended even to extremity, if need were, this one moſt certain verity, That a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan hath a juriſdiction, as ſolid and good a juriſdiction over byſhops, as any theſe can have or plead for over pariſh prieſts. And by as firm and good and ancient law is the one eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as the other, and indeed by the very ſame; whilſt a miniſter of his own preſumes to tell the Arch-byſhop his own prelate to his face, that he hath no juriſdiction at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His</hi> 9 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 91. <hi>to</hi> 169.</p>
            <p>Is wholly fanatick. There he tells us plainly, That <hi>neither Convocations, Byſhops, nor Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are judges of our faith:</hi> That <hi>the Engliſh Church doth not puniſh for difference in opinions, nor require that all ſhould beleev as ſhe beleevs, or ſubmit to her determinations, but leaves every man to the liberty of his own judgment, ſo he do not make factions againſt her. Who ever urged men.</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57771:78"/>ſaith he, <hi>to beleev as the Church beleevs?</hi> p. 101. Alſo, that <hi>no decrees of any Church are further to be admitted, then they appear to particular mens judgments to agree with ſcriptur.</hi> That <hi>every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man muſt make uſe of his own reaſon, to judg or reject doctrin and rites propounded, though ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptur be his guide.</hi> That <hi>the buſineſs muſt there end, without reſigning to any further authority, which is all as fallible as we be our ſelves:</hi> That <hi>points fund amental are as perſpicuous as the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, and points not fundamental, the Church doth not determin them; and if any diſpute ſhould riſe about them, ſhe ſilences indeed, but expects not her children, ſhould be of her opinion, only would not have them gainſay her:</hi> That <hi>that Church does but mock us, which expects a beleef to her propoſals, becaus ſhe pretends to guide her ſelf by ſcriptur. For if ſcriptur muſt bend to their decrees, and we muſt have no ſence of ſcriptur, but what they think fit, then their decrees and not, ſcriptur is our laſt rule: And it is a pretty deviſe,</hi> quoth he, <hi>firſt to rule the rule, and then be ruled by it, &amp;c.</hi> Can a good Quaker ſay more for himſelf, or deſire more to be ſaid for him. If we be not bound to beleev, we are not bound to hear. Nay, we are bound not to hear any ſuch Church, leſt we ſhould chance to beleev what aforehand we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and they themſelvs dare not juſtifie.</p>
            <p>He hath much of this talk up and down in his book; <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith he p. 439. <hi>cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57771:78"/>By taking this liberty of diſcretion from men, we force them to becom hypocrits, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs outwardly what inwardly they disbeleev.</hi> And again p. 450. <hi>We allow not any man openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Churches decrees. But when he thinks contrary to the determination of our Church, he muſt keep his judgment to himſelf, only refuſing obedience with all humility, till he be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> No fanatick will deſire to refuſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience any longer.</p>
            <p>Thus doth this champion deliver up himſelf and Church, unto the will and diſpoſal of all whatever ſects; and cares not, ſo he may avoid catholik obeyſance, to make himſelf a prey to thoſe, who upon theſe grounds here laid down, will ſoon turn him out of Church and pulpit too, and ſtrip him not only of his cloak, but his coat alſo.</p>
            <p>At laſt he anſwers the catholik arguments for the Churches aſſured and infallible guidance, juſt as he did before your others for ſupremacy. Seeing him there, you ſee him every where.</p>
            <p>Finally he brings in, for a certain teſtimony of the Churches liability to errour, the two opinions ſo rife in old time, about communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating infants, and the Millenaries thouſand years of bleſſedneſs with Chriſt in this world, after dooms-day: <hi>Which are both of them now condemned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by a contrary beleef and practice of the preſent Church, although they were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57771:79"/>held by not a few very antient Fathers in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</hi> And in this he triumphs exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Surely without caus I ſhould think. Thoſe primitive doctors, we may be aſſured, knew ſomthing more then their Catechiſm, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, ſomthing of that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, beyond their Chriſtian faith, as well as the preſent Fathers and Doctors of the Church now do. And if there were ſo great varieties of opinion among them concerning thoſe two things, as there are now adayes among catholik doctors about a thouſand others, it is a ſign that thoſe two points did not belong to their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme of faith, then aſſuredly known, but only to ſcholaſtical Theology, eſpecially ſith they had neither clear ſcriptur or general councel, nor aſſured tradition for either ſide.</p>
            <p>And it is of no moment, that ſom of them ſhould be ſo confident of their opinion, as to think it to be a right firm Chriſtian beleef. For ſo I have heard my ſelf, many a ſchool Divine in catholik countreys, to ſay of his <hi>Theſis</hi> or ſchool poſition, the better to countenance his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that it was either faith or very near it. Beſides I do not know, that the preſent Church hath ever declared, in any cannon of her faith, either that the faithfull ſhall not reign upon earth a thouſand years with Chriſt, after dooms-day: or that we may not communicate the Euchariſt to children; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57771:79"/>this laſt is declared not neceſſary.</p>

               <hi>His</hi> 10 <hi>ch. from page</hi> 169. <hi>to</hi> 180.</p>
            <p>Is againſt prayer for the dead and Purgatory. Where, both by the teſtimonies which you, Sir, do cite in your book, and by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he brings himſelf, Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> acknowledges that praying and offering for the dead is a very ancient and general cuſtom amongſt Chriſtians. Nay, that S. Paul himſelf prayed for his deceaſed friend Oneſiphorus: This I ſay he plainly grants p. 182. But he addes, that <hi>all this does not infer Purgatory,</hi> or that <hi>Purgatory is a place under ground near hell, where is fire and darknes, or that all are in pain and torments there.</hi> And ſo he puſles to the end of his chapter; acknowledging faith, and denying only theology. For whether Purgatory ſignifie any one place, as our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is apt to fancy, or only a ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſom ſouls departed out of this viſible world, I ſee Mr. Whitby underſtands not, that it is no Chriſtian faith, but a meer ſcholaſtical divinity. But that our prayers, offerings, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and good deeds, do benefit the ſouls deceaſed; this the very teſtimonies cited by Mr. Whitby himſelf, as they do ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſo do they confirm catholik faith, though they touch not upon theology at all. And ſo while he oppugns the divinity of ſom catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, he eſtabliſhes the catholik faith of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57771:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> In the interim he ought to remember, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this he often forgets himſelf, that by the very teſtimonies, not only which you Sir do bring for Purgatory, but thoſe alſo which Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> has againſt it, we may ſee manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Proteſtant Church hath much ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ancient primitive practice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chriſtians. For Proteſtants have neither prieſts, nor altars, nor offerings, nor ſacrifice, nor ſatisfactions, nor expiations for the dead, which thoſe authorities ſpeak of.</p>

            <p>The real preſence under the elements of the Euchariſt, Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> here will not by any means endure. And he hath one ſhield of a word, which conſiſts of almoſt as many ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as <hi>Ajax</hi> his buckler of bulls hides, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell all autorities that may witneſs it. <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,</hi> that is the word. Thou ſeeſt, ſaith St. Chriſoſtom, upon the altar the very body which the wiſe-men ſaw and worſhipped. <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> ſaith Whitby. Again, The moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing in heaven I will ſhew thee upon earth, ſaith the ſame father. It is <hi>ſhewed repreſentative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaith Whitby; it is ſeen repreſentatively. I dare not adore the earth, ſaith St. Auguſtin, and yet I have learned how the earth is to be adored; becaus fleſh is of the earth, and our Lord gave us his fleſh to eat, which no man eats except he firſt adore. <hi>It is Chriſt,</hi> ſaith Whitby,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57771:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>who is adored repreſentatively.</hi> And if any words will not bear that diſtinction, then are they all ſpurious. Nay, if any ſhould ſay expreſly, that not only Chriſt in heaven, but his very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is worſhipped, this man will tells us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, who hath as many ſhifts in readineſs, where one will not ſerv his turn, as Achelous had to ſlip out of the hands of Hercules, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>But he has, poor man, no very good memory. For after he had in this one chapter, ſpent many of his pages, to ſhow that the real preſence was not the former faith of Chriſtians, and that they never adored the Euchariſt, he lets fall a word by chance in the very cloſe, which ſpoils all; by giving us to underſtand, that this was ſo univerſal a beleef and practis among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that it came even to the notice of Infidels; and that it was withall of ſo great concernment amongſt beleevers, that it expreſſed their whole religion, as the abridgment of their faith, and great capital work of their devotion. <hi>Quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem Chriſtiani adorant quod comedunt, ſit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mea cum Philoſophis.</hi> It was the ſpeech of Avicen, ſaith Whitby, although I think it was Averroes, who well enough underſtood both of them the natur of Chriſtian religion, not only by what they ſaw themſelves, but what they had read from more ancient writers, both
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57771:81"/>Chriſtian, pagan, and Mahometan up and down the world, concerning the religion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Since the Chriſtians worſhip that which they eat,</hi> ſaith that Infidel, <hi>let my ſould be with Philoſophers.</hi>

            <p>Labours much for the general uſe of the Cup in all Communions. But neither does Mr. Whitby, nor can he diſtinguiſh, as appears by his diſcours, wherein he ſayes, that <hi>otherwiſe ther would not be a repreſentation of Chriſts death,</hi> which is the wiſeſt word he ſpeaks in all this whole chapter; I ſay he knows not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh, that ther is in that one Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtian liturgy a double action, the one of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and offering to God, the other of giving or communicating to the people. In the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and offering of the ſacred ſimbols does only the ſacrifice, which is a repreſentation of Chriſts death, conſiſt. But the communicating of theſe ſymbols to the people, is only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the former, and no formal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lords death at all. But he does not know, and you need not heed what he ſayes.</p>
            <p>The concomitance of our Lords body and blood, where ever it be in any one or other of the ſpecies or ſymbols, which may enough juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie communion in one kinde, he tells you very roundly, <hi>it is a figment.</hi> But if he had heeded the very practis of his own Church, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57771:81"/>indeed he never does, he would have forborn thoſe words. For when the Proteſtant miniſter gives the people firſt the bread, and ſayes, <hi>Take, and eat this in remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, and feed upon him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving;</hi> Do not the miniſters words there imply a concomitance before the cup come; even as perfect a concomitance, as you Sir can plead for? I think they do. For ſurely they intend not, to feed only upon one half of him.</p>

            <p>Declares, that alms-deeds and preaching of the Goſpel is a ſacrifice. But the Euchariſt he will not allow to be any true ſacrifice at all. Although to put by your arguments and ſolid reaſonings for it, he grants it may be called a <hi>Symbolical</hi> ſacrifice. And ſo he has caught hold of another diſtinction, which runs quite through this matter; or rather put the ſame diſtinction into other characters. And if any ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as ther are enough, do give teſtimony, that our Lords body and blood in the Euchariſt is offered, immolated, and ſacrificed on Chriſtian altars, by the prieſt, for our attonement; <hi>It is to be underſtood,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>to be offered ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically,</hi> immolated ſymbolically, ſacrificed ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically, figuratively, ſignificatively, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively. And though you beat his head never ſo much with your autorities and reaſons, ſo long
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57771:82"/>as <hi>ſymbolically</hi> remains there, you do but beat the air.</p>
            <p>But where are any altars in our Engliſh Churches, or any ſacrifices offered, or immolated theron? And how comes it to paſs, that all theſe hundred years of our ſeparation from Roman unity, our people have never been told, that they have prieſts ſtill amongſt them, and altars, and ſacrifice, although they be but ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical ones; ſymbolical ſacrifice, ſymbolical altars, and ſymbolical prieſts. For ſacrifice is the very form and eſſence of all religion. And they that know ſo much, would have been much ſatisfied, to hear, that they have yet a ſacrifice, at leaſt a ſymbolical ſacrifice amongſt them. I will be bold to ſay, that not one man of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion has ever heard of any ſuch thing in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh pulpit, or ever read it in a catechiſm. The miniſter of the word and word of the miniſter, that is all we ever hear of. But it is thought perhaps, that <hi>ſymbolical Prieſt</hi> would make but a jarring ſound, like two voices in a defective octave, which have a ſemblance and ſhadow of a perfect concord, but coming ſhort of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the harſheſt and worſt of diſcords in our ear.</p>
            <p>That our Lords death upon the Croſs was a true and real ſacrifice to God for mankinde, all Catholiks know well enough, and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters need not put them in minde of that, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57771:82"/>already they beleev. But as the ſacrifices of the old law were inſtituted by almighty God, to be often iterated, before the paſſion of the great Meſſias, for a continual exerciſe of religion, in order to his future death: So did the ſame Lord, for the very ſame purpos of religious exerciſe, inſtitute another to be iterated after his death, unto which once paſt, it was to have reference, as the former had a relation to the ſame death and paſſion when it was to com. And this the very goſpel, if we would but underſtand it by the ancient practis of the Church, which interprets all written words, ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares.</p>
            <p>And though this great ſacrifice be exhibited in Euchariſtian ſpecies and ſymbols, yet do all Fathers and ancient Councels ſpeak clearly, that it is a real, true, and propitiatory ſacrifice, though accompanied alſo with a figur; and not only a figurative and ſymbolical one. A child may be the figur of his father, and yet is he not rightly ſaid to be only a figurative and ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical child. A ſacrifice only ſymbolical, a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative altar, and repreſentative prieſthood, make only a ſymbolical, figurative and repreſentative religion.</p>

            <p>Rejects images and ſacred figures, as both uſeles and ſinful: And Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> ſeems here (good Sir pardon me) to have got indeed a real
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57771:83"/>vantage over you. Doubtles you were ſomwhat overſeen, when you wrote in your book, moſt adviſed in other things and ſerious, theſe ill pondered words to Proteſtants. <hi>Were there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to any of you, thinking of other matters, a pictur of our Lord hanging upon a Croſs, could you poſsibly avoid the calling to mind, who our Lord was, and what he hath done and ſuffered for you? &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Ask your heart, and you will find, that you would not place St. Peters pictur or the Kings in an unclean place, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay you are to blame, Sir, to think men of that way ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, or prone to devotion. For <hi>Whitby</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes you by an evident demonſtration. <hi>Alas,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I ſee every day Crucifixes in our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg windows, and yet never find any ſuch effect wrought in me, as you talk of.</hi> Indeed neither thoſe Colledges, nor windows in the colledges, nor Crucifixes in the windows, were ever ſet up by their good Catholik founders, for any ſuch ſtudents, as <hi>Whitby</hi> is, who findes, it ſeems, no effect wrought in him there, by the ſight of any thing, but his good chamber, diſtributions, and dinner provided for him in the hall.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the connatural reſpect you plead for, as due to figures by force of their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of reſpected perſons, by an example of a Kings pictur, he confutes it nimbly. <hi>I would not fear,</hi> quoth Whitby, <hi>to tear his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties picturs, which ſomtimes may be found in ſmoaky
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57771:83"/>Alehouſes, &amp;c.</hi> he puts them in ſmoaky Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, the better to cover his own rudenes; <hi>nor would I ſcruple,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to put a piece of Popiſh Maſs, wherin were haply an Epiſtle or Goſpel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, unto an unclean uſe.</hi> And here alſo, he puts the Goſpel in a Maſs-book, as before he ſet the Kings pictur in a ſmoaky alehouſe, to prevent offence, that ſom tender one amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, might take at his uncivil talk.</p>
            <p>In brief, he will not allow any figur or image, though it were a Crucifix, to have any influence upon our minds unto good thoughts, any more then the <hi>pictur of Bradſhaw or Cromwell, hell or the devil.</hi> Somtimes he ſayes they caus bad thoughts, but never any good ones. And yet he addes, <hi>that Proteſtants do keep up picturs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, though the cries of fanaticks be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo loud againſt them, becaus of the hiſtorical uſe they have.</hi> What hiſtorical uſe can they have, in the name of God, if the ſight of them, as <hi>Whitby</hi> himſelf here ſpeaks, can bring no part of ſacred hiſtory to our minds; nor the very Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix have ſo much influence upon us, as to mind us who our Lord was, or what he hath don or ſuffered for us,? Unles he will ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual method of anſwering, that they bring into our minds the hiſtory of the civil wars betwixt Ceſar and Pompey. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if theſe kind of ſacred images and figures caus only evil thoughts, and no good ones, the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57771:84"/>cry of fanaticks againſt them, notwithſtanding any hiſtorical uſe, which according to Whitby, although he talk of it, is none at all, will not be judged unjuſt.</p>
            <p>In concluſion he will needs have the Papiſts both to worſhip their Images, and pray to them. And this, becaus they uſe them common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Oratories, whither they retire from places of worldly buſines, to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and pray, when time and devotion invites them to it. But if for this the Papiſt muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his doom, what will <hi>Whitby</hi> ſay, when he ſhall be accuſed himſelf, for worſhipping the roof and rafters of the Church, towards which he caſts up his eyes, when he ſtands in his pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to pray, before and after his ſermon. Even the poor Jews were derided by the Roman Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt, as adorers of the Welkin and clouds. And who can eſcape the cenſur, whether he have ſom pious repreſentation before him, to fix his fancy, or turn only to the wall and ſtones. He muſt ſtill kneel before ſomthing, whether he be within door, or without in the open air. And if he have the aſſiſtance of his crucified redeemer repreſented before him, it is probable enough it may help to recollect his mind, to humble his ſpirit, and fix his fancy; at leaſt it can do no hurt. And if I may and needs muſt frame an idea or pictur of him in my mind, why may I not have it in mine eye too?</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57771:84"/>
            <p> But Mr. Whitby will have it, whatever you, or the whole world knows to the contrary, that <hi>Papiſts pray to picturs, and conſequently make a God of them.</hi> And he will not have them any more excuſable, <hi>then thoſe Iſraelites who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God in a Calf.</hi> Here Sir I learn what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew before, that the idolatrous Iſraelites worſhipped God in a calf. He that ſhall worſhip a calf for God, I could never in my life yet conceiv how he ſhould worſhip God in a calf. Moſes worſhipped God in a flaming buſh. And why? Becaus God was by a peculiar preſence in that buſh or flame, to terminate that worſhip. Nor was he blamable in worſhipping God ſo preſent there. But God was not ſo preſent in that golden ſtatue of the molten heifer, which the Hebrews had ſet up in Moſes abſence, as the very God which brought them out of Egypt, that they could be ſaid to worſhip God in it. And if he had been ſo preſent in it, they might ſurely as well have fallen down before him there, as any where els. The heathen, whom the holy Prophet rebuked ſo earneſtly for worſhipping the ſtars and hoſt of heaven, did they alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the ſtars or heavens? ſurely then they were not blame-worthy. Where ever God is by a peculiar preſence, as in heaven and Moſes his flame, there may and ought he to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. And ſo Chriſtians worſhipped God even in the man Jeſus, our great and bleſſed Lord.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57771:85"/>But his figur or effigies has no more of Gods preſence in it, then the wall it hangs upon; ſave only the reflection of his outward effigies, to recollect the fancy. And the reſpect, if we will ſpeak properly, does not terminate upon the pictur, but upon the perſon whom it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; which infers a worſhip of God in it, not by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>from page</hi> 247 <hi>to</hi> 273.</p>
            <p>Is very earneſt for ſcriptur and liturgy in a vulgar tongue. This plea of Proteſtant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters makes a plauſible ſound. And they know it well enough. For it was the firſt thing that by their rhetorical colours caſt upon it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the people, after the Apoſtacy of the firſt reformers; by whoſe perſwaſion, the people was then made to beleev, they ſhould now be as gods, all of them, knowing good and evil. <hi>The word of God,</hi> ſaith Whitby, <hi>is kept from the knowledge of the vulgar people in the Roman Church.</hi> And thus they all ſay and ever will ſay; be they never ſo much ſatisfied by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik writers to the contrary: becaus it is to their own advantage it ſhould be ſo thought in England, and all other places, where Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have invaded, and now actually ſit upon the Catholick Clergies benefice and byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks.</p>
            <p>But is ther any part or particle of Chriſtian faith or religion, or of the word of God, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57771:85"/>is kept from Catholiks, or not made known to them, in Books, Catechiſmes, Sermons, all in their own language, and in daily practis of that Church, wherof they are members? Do they not hear, and read, and ſee all the myſteries of our Chriſtian faith, Chriſt our Lords birth and paſſion, reſurrection and aſcenſion into glory? what he acted, what he ſuffered, what he taught, what he conſtituted and ordained for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what we are to hope, what to beleev, what to practice in order thereunto, ſet before their eyes, not only by continual ſermons, made to them, all over the catholik world, in their own vulgar tongue, but by their Goſpels and Epiſtles, which they have lying by them, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the cours of the whole year, and tranſlated into their own language, together with ſeveral pious treatiſes, and meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe rules and myſteries of faith, unto ſo ample uſe, that if they do but walk according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is all that religion intends, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſs ſalvation. Is not all this Gods word? It is nothing els. And what is ther more of the word of God, except we will count letters and ſyllables? The word of God then is not kept from the knowledg of the vulgar people in the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>But <hi>why have they not the Bible tranſlated, as it lies, in all languages, where catholik faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt?</hi> Becaus it is obſcure as it lies, in that ſhort
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57771:86"/>and ambiguous phraſe, and under ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tropes of rhetorick, and ſchemes alſo of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, wherin it was wrote, apt therby to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and miſunderſtood, as we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be true, unto endles factions. Nor does the word of God conſiſt ſo much in letters and ſyllables, as in the marrow and meaning of his will. And not the ſence and meaning, but the letter of the ſcriptur is that which makes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
            <p>But <hi>is not that the word of God which is kept from the people?</hi> It is the word of God, but not kept from the people. For it is but the ſame with that, which is delivered and made known unto the people. So much as it contains, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be either of faith or morality, either of what is to be beleeved, or hoped, or practiſed, they have it all; but diſintangled from thoſe artificiall ſchemes of logick and rhetorick, wherof the holy writ is fuller then any book was ever writ by man, which there inwrap and render it obſcure. Ther is no inſtruction, no rule of piety, no particle of comfort, either for this world or the other, in St. Pauls epiſtles, for example, but Catholiks have it; they read it in their own language, if they be able to read, they know it all. And they have it in a better and more facil manner, then they could find it out, by peruſing thoſe high theological diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of his, which the learnedſt of men can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57771:86"/>hardly, and very hardly underſtand. The like I ſay of other portions of holy writ. Only the diſputative part, with the interwoven ſyſtems of rhetorick, this may exerciſe great and more ſublime divines, who by help of their various litterature may conſider, not only the plain truths therin contained, which are common to them with other vulgar beleevers, but the nature of the Metonymies, Synechdoche's, Metaphors, together with the ſeveral modes of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, refutation, objections and inopinate tranſitions in the context. This, if my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary OeN had underſtood, it had ſaved one fourth part of his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon <hi>Fiat Lux;</hi> and <hi>Whitby</hi> here had been utterly ſilent. But it is their only advantage both in this and other controverted points of faith with Roman Catholiks, either to be ignorant, or diſſemble their knowledg. And therfor I have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, they will never ſeem to underſtand. But God grant they may.</p>
            <p>The wonder is, that Engliſh Proteſtants ſhould ſtill be as fiercely eager in this point, when they write controverſies, as ever they were; when they do themſelves moſt heartily repent, (I have heard ſeveral great clergy-men amongſt them ſpeak it) that they had ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Bible in that ſhort ambiguous phraſe it is penned, into the hands of people in their own tongue, to be thus perverted, as it is, every one
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57771:87"/>his own way, unto endles and irreconcilable ſchiſmes. It would glad their hearts, no doubt, to ſee the Roman Church do indiſcreetly as they have don. But that will never be.</p>
            <p>Holy catholik Church has revealed, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſeveral wayes made known the will of God to her people, appointing moſt divine wayes and methods, ſuch as ſhe had her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God, to inure and keep them in the practis of that their holy faith. And the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and ſublimer divinity, or, as I may ſo ſpeak, the philoſophical part of holy writ, ſuch as can may read on Gods name, and the Church will commend them for it; while theſe, with all the reſt, attend unto thoſe duties and good works, every one in his calling, which their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith preſcribes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are and ever were the wayes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the now preſent and ancient catholik Church, moſt wiſe and holy. And her ſubjects and beleevers have profited therby, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them, unto angelical ſanctity; and all of them unto ſomthing more, than otherwiſe they would have had: whilſt others that ſwerv from theſe wayes, promote themſelvs unto wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſchiſme without end, miſſing indeed the word of God in the very ſcripture they read, and never attaining to the true life and power in that form of words, which they uſe not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to intended ſanctification, but by their own
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57771:87"/>miſinter pretations wreſt and deprave daily unto their own deſtruction. Nor will people be ruled now by their miniſters, but thinking it their own right to interpret as they pleas, make it their only work to read, and cant ſentences, and coin opinions as they liſt.</p>
            <p>Excepting only this one fruit of our vulgar reading of ſcripture, as it lies, which in all mens judgments is an evil fruit, I do not ſee, nor can I know, what our Proteſtants can have, if all other things were equal, above vulgar Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks by their ſcriptur tranſlated, as it lies, in its own phraſe. Do they know any more of the myſteries of ſalvation, Sacraments, or hopes of a life to com, or ſincerity of a pious life, then the other? I am ſure they do leſs, whatever they know, and are ſo taught to do. Or does any Proteſtant, after he has read a chapter, know any more of what is expedient for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then before he began it. <hi>It renews,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>and moves devotion.</hi> Devotion to what? Are they not taught by the Reformation, that the good works there commended to our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis, are all mortal ſins? And therfor do our people ſo read and hear, that in hearing and reading they wholly acquieſce, and trouble themſelvs no further. And they do wiſely in it. For who would chaſtiſe his body, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his appetites, or give alms, and ſin ſo many wayes, with ſo much expences and trouble, when
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57771:88"/>he may as well do nothing, and ſin leſs. And do not the ſacred goſpel, which Catholiks read in their own language, with pious meditations annexed for that very purpos, which alſo they are taught to read for no other end, move devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too? And this I judg to be right piety. Whereas to read, only to ſay that I have read, or to find out new ways, or ſtrengthen my ſelf therin, is but vanity and ſin.</p>
            <p>After a duty is once known, Catholiks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv then no further thing remains, but only their correſponding practis, which is with all their forces to be put in ure, according to the dictates of that their rule of faith, now ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtood, unto their ſanctification and merit. Whilſt others think nothing behind, but only to read over again what they knew before, that they may have words in their head to talk of. Which of theſe is right Chriſtianity, he knew well enough who ſaid, <hi>Fidelis ſermo, &amp; de his volo te confirmare, ut curent bonis operibus praeeſſe qui credunt Deo:</hi> It is a faithful ſaying, and of this I would have you to be ſtrongly confirmed, that ſuch as once have beleeved in God, attend unto good works: Theſe things are good and profitable to men, but other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, controverſies, and contentions, (which are the only fruit of our vulgar reading of ſcriptur in its own ſhort ambiguous phraſe) theſe do thou avoid; for they are uſeles and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57771:88"/>vain. This is St Pauls mind, and I think he had the Spirit of God in him.</p>
            <p>As for the ſacred liturgy which Mr <hi>Whitby</hi> would alſo have in a vulgar tongue, if he knew what the <hi>Meſſach</hi> or <hi>Catholick Liturgy</hi> is, which here I do not intend to teach him, he would know that it could no more be underſtood in Engliſh then in Hebrew, Latine or Greek. For in it the Prieſt does but offer and pray ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively for the peoples attonement, unto him who equally underſtands all languages; and people offer with him, as they are taught, and know well enough to do, all their ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, either with words or without them, in the mediation of his blood, who reconciled the world in his fleſh to God, which reconciliation is figured and repeated in their Meſſach, for their religious exerciſe and comfort. And the great capital work of a true religion ought to be common unto all, not to thoſe only who hear, and ſpeak, and ſee, but even to the deaf and blind and dumb; how ever theſe may fail in other inferiour and leſs neceſſary duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>from p.</hi> 273. <hi>to</hi> 369.</p>
            <p>Maintains very ſtoutly, firſt, <hi>that the Saints and Angels of God do not pray for us in heaven, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in general or in particular:</hi> Secondly, <hi>that they do not aſsiſt, help or protect us by their preſence on earth.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>that to truſt to any ſuch help, is to reſt in them, as our final end, and to make
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57771:89"/>them our Gods.</hi> Though the two firſt be as much diſſonant to any true religion, as the laſt to reaſon; yet will Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> hold them all three. And he has an evaſion for any grounds or reaſonings you or any Catholik can make; an evaſion at hand as ſmart and ſenceles, as any of thoſe he gave before againſt Supremacy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But this your catholik doctrin about Angels he buts and runns at it, with moſt frightful and horned dilemma's. <hi>So many millions of Angel-guardians,</hi> quoth he, <hi>if for example upon the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival of St. Peter, they go up to heaven to St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their pupils prayers, who guards their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? and if they do not go up, who preſents their prayers?</hi> Again, <hi>When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>theſe Angel meſſengers com ſo may thouſand of them at once to tell the Virgin Mary of her new ſuitors, how can ſhe have any quiet to ſay her prayers? And if ſhe ſay her own prayers quietly, how can they tell her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of ſo many new ſuitors?</hi> Again, <hi>Have all the houſes in London, and all the Papiſt houſes in Rome, ſo many Angels as will guard them, and keep the Devil from ſetting them on fire, or not? If they have, then are the Angels finely employed: If they have not, why doth not the enemy ſet a fire on them every night?</hi> Again, <hi>Had Jobs cammels, oxen and aſſes ther Angel-guardian, or no? If not, why then did Satan complain he could not com at them? If they had, then muſt we allow our Author Mr. Creſſy one.</hi> Is not this notable divinity?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57771:89"/>Surely <hi>Hudibras</hi> was but an aſs to <hi>Whitby.</hi> This, this is the man of whom the poet ſings <hi>Canto</hi> 1. This is he, <hi>In ſchool divinity as able, As he that height irrefragable, A ſecond Thomas, or at once, To name them all another Duns.</hi> But all this countrey divinity Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> gathered, I know well enough, <hi>à ſenſibilibus,</hi> from the natur and property of his ſerving-boy, who cannot go of an errand and ſtay too; cannot ſup and blow together; cannot tell a tale and whiſtle both at once; cannot ſpeak of Jobs aſſes, but he muſt remember Mr. Creſſy.</p>
            <p>In truth, though Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> be thus extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, yet can I not perſwade my ſelf, that other graver Proteſtants are ſo likewiſe. For when Chriſt our Lord comforts his poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and terrifies their oppreſſing adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with this his divine ratiocination, <hi>See that you do not abuſe or contemn any of theſe my little ones. For I ſay unto you, that their Angels do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behold the face of my Father who is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he ſeems apparently to ſpeak ſomthing, that ſerves directly for the catholik beleef, and is conſequently againſt theſe three aſſertions of <hi>Whitby</hi> to the contrary. For thoſe angel-guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, whom our Lord calls <hi>their angels,</hi> the angels of his beleevers, and of his little ones, either they muſt be ſo perſpicatious, as one way or other to ſee even in heaven, where they behold the face of God in glory, all the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57771:90"/>and neceſſities of them whoſe angels they are: or at leaſt, whilſt they are preſent on earth, with them whoſe angels they be, they muſt ſtill ſee and enjoy the God of glory who is in heaven: Both theſe things are poſſible; and, whether it be this or that, they muſt needs be both ſo potent and good, as to be able and willing, when they ſee time, to aſſiſt and help them in their afflictions and need, whoſe angels they are, either by praying for them in general, or in particular, or by ſtrengthening, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, protecting their perſons. And laſtly, poor man may comfort himſelf in this inviſible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whatever it be, and however it be wrought, without making thoſe angels his gods, or relying upon them as his final end.</p>
            <p>And all this muſt be intended by our Lord and Saviour in that his comfortable ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhould think, if it conclude any thing. If they be not there inſinuated, it is very hard to ſay what it may conclude. If the angels do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray for us, nor any way aſſiſt and help us, nor we can without danger of ſin rely on any ſuch aſſiſtance, then ſurely to ſay, <hi>Let none abuſe my little ones, for their angels, &amp;c.</hi> would be a ratiocination as impertinent, as to ſay, <hi>Let none abuſe, &amp;c. for the North and South poles are half the heavens diſtant:</hi> and far more dangerous. For man could hardly be perſwaded by ſuch a ſpeech, to put any truſt in that diſtance of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57771:90"/>poles, as here he cannot but be moved to take comfort in that acquaintance and nearnes we have with angels, which any way to rely on, Mr. Whitby tell us, is to reſt in them as our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal end, and make them our gods.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh Mr. Whitby would firſt conſult his own reaſon, whether any way to rely on the comfort of ſecond cauſes viſible or inviſible, infer neceſſarily, that we do rely upon them as our ultimate end, and make them our gods, as he affirms more then once in this his 16 chapter: And again, I deſire him, that he would be more wary, and take heed how he ſpeaks againſt the angels of God, and deride thoſe hoſts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in whom our Lord Chriſt adviſed us, if I underſtand him right, to take comfort; leſt they ſtrike him, as ſom others they have don, with ſudden death. Poor Catholiks are yet in their pilgrimage and place of ſufferance, who muſt therfor patiently endure all ſcoffs, contumelies and ſlanders, for their futur merit. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God are in glory, and bleſſed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for not to be blaſphemed or mockt at by inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent duſt; or their protection and aſſiſtance to be ſlighted.</p>
            <p>What is the eſſence of Angels, what their preſence, or how great their power, we cannot here under our thick corporeal veil conceiv. They may, for ought we can tell, be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly preſent all at once, both here on earth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57771:91"/>and heaven too, unto any effect of perceiving or operating, as a man is preſent within the four walls of his chamber. At leaſt if our Lord whom we pretend all of us equally to beleev, hath ſo clearly allowed us, to ſupport our ſelves in their aſſiſtance, however it be wrought, no man I ſhould think, who bears the name of Chriſtian, can with any modeſty affirm, as <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> does here, that they neither pray for us in heaven, nor aſſiſt us on earth; nor that we can any way ſupport our ſelvs in any comfort from them, without making them our gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ch.</hi> 17. <hi>from page</hi> 369 <hi>to</hi> 410.</p>
            <p>Is very bitter againſt the celibacy and ſingle life of prieſts, and exclaims on the contrary, with very broad language, that you may ſee he is very ſenſible of what he ſayes, againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes of the clergy, not excepting any, nor allowing ſo much as a poſſibility to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>And I doubt not,</hi> ſaith he, p. 378. <hi>whether ſuch advocates of Celibacy, as M. C. if ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry were made, might not be often found where the Card. of Crema was.</hi> Where that man was found, I do not know. In all likelihood it was in ſom place where Jobs aſſes uſe to graze, for he lately made you, Sir, one of them.</p>
            <p>Good Sir, do not hate the man, as he deſervs, but pitty, pardon, and pray for him. He has mocked away his own angel-guardian, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therfor be civil towards men. Mr. Whitby
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57771:91"/>underſtands not the ſeveral wayes and means preſcribed by catholik religion, as a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt the incurſions of that, or any other ſenſual temptation. He is unacquainted either with their frequent faſtings, or diſciplines, or hair-cloth, or continual and hourly exerciſe of pſalms, hymns, and canticles, which take up in a manner all the whole life of the Roman Clergy. That man who uſes heartily ſuch like exerciſes, commended by catholik religion, will eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due any whatever temptation, if ever it ſhould aſſault him, as they know well enough who practis that their religion ſeriouſly, and prevent oftentimes its very aſſault. But if any will be ſo forgetful of his own welfare, as utterly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe ſacred means, he may fall deſervedly into a lower religion, and becom a <hi>Whitby.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are either in bed with their wives, or thinking haply after one, when the catholik clergy, if they correſpond with their duty and calling, are watching and ſaying their ſacred mattins, which conſiſt of many divine leſſons, pſalms, anthems, reſponſories, hymns; canticles, which put divine and ſpiritual thoughts into their minds. When miniſters are feaſting, they faſt: When they are careſſing their miſtriſſes, theſe chaſtiſe their body with diſciplines: When they, got out of their beds, are at their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings draught, theſe are ſaying their Lauds and Prime, and devoutly diſpoſing themſelves by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57771:92"/>prayer and meditation upon their knees, unto their ſacred liturgy: When they are eating and drinking, and mannaging worldly affairs about their wives and children, theſe are at their Sext and None, and Veſpars, and Compline, that they may fulfill their daily task of prayers and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their Redeemer. I ſay no more, but of this I am and will be conſident, that if Mr. Whitby had ever practiſed, or ſeen the lives and converſations of Roman Prieſts, thoſe viſible angels of God, or been otherwiſe acquainted therewith, he would not have ſo boldly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he does, even againſt the very tenour of goſpel, (which ſaith, that ſom are made eunuchs by men, and ſom again make themſelvs ſo for the kingdom of heaven) that it is impoſſible to be chaſt. Nor would he ſo univerſally calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all profeſſours of chaſtity for the wickednes of ſom few, who have in ſom particular ages and places given offence by their evil lives unto Catholiks, whoſe teſtimony Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> uſes againſt them. But commonly men judg of others as they act themſelvs. And he that keeps himſelf chaſt, will in charity think ſo of other men.</p>
            <p>When you ſay Sir, and all catholiks with you, that it is indeed a doctrin of devils both perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and fals, to forbid marriage abſolutely as evil and unlawful in it ſelf, as did the Encratites, Montaniſts, Marcionites, and Manichees; but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57771:92"/>yet relatively and upon ſom particular account may ſom perſons notwithſtanding be withheld from marriage for diviner purpoſes, as catholik Church uſes. For ſo the women, which were particularly addicted to the ſervice of the altar, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have them to be elderly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, leſt being young, they ſhould grow wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton from Chriſt, and deſire to marry. This diſtinction will in no wiſe ſerv Mr. <hi>Whitby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſaith he <hi>with his reverend Hall, the doctrin thus ſtigmatiſed by the apoſtle as the doctrin of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils is in general of ſuch as do forbid marriage, and not upon this or that particular account. And the act is all one whether the prohibition be relative or abſolute, as poiſon is poiſon whether abſolutely or conditionally taken.</hi> Thus ſpeaks Whitby with his reverend Hall, thence inferring, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, that it is as full and truly the doctrin of devils to forbid marriage to any one upon any account, of ſerving God more purely and the like, as it is to forbid it abſolutely as evil and unlawful in it ſelf; as poiſon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But is this true? Poiſon conditionally taken, or taken upon condition, either of a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt it, or of ſom diſeas, whereof it is a proper remedy, may not poiſon or hurt the man that takes it, but rather help perhaps and cure him. And if it do not poiſon but help, then is it no poiſon to him, but phyſick.</p>
            <p>And do they forbid marriage as in it ſelf
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57771:93"/>unlawful, who do relatively prohibit it? Or is it equally the doctrin of devils to withhold it, as unlawful to all, or only to ſom upon a ſpecial occaſion? Do they condemn it in it ſelf who withhold it in relation to ſom times or perſons? That I may omit other ſeveral reaſons, which may convince this aſſertion of folly and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, how coms our Church of England to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid marriage in Advent and Lent, and ſom other times of the year? Is not this a relative prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? And doth our Church of England therfor abſolutely forbid it in it ſelf, becaus ſhe relatively forbids it? I am ſure the prohibition is as much relative, to forbid marriage to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at ſom times, as to forbid it to ſom perſons at all times. And if the doctrin be ſtigmatized in general, upon what account ſoever it run, then doth the Church of England hold and teach the doctrin of devils, when upon this or that particular account, ſhe prohibits marriage, although ſhe abſolutely allows it, as the Roman Church does.</p>
            <p>The rubrick of our Engliſh Church now put into our Almanack runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Times prohibiting Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marriage comes in the 23 of January, and by the 7 of February it goes out again until Low Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, at which time it coms in again, and goes not out till Rogation Sunday from that time it is unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden until Advent Sunday. But then it goes out,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57771:93"/>and coms not in again till the 23. of January fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</hi> All which in the phraſe of Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> and <hi>Whitby</hi> his champion runs thus.</p>
            <p>Times commanding the doctrin of devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The doctrin of devils goes out the 23 of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and by the 7 of February it comes in again; until Low Sunday, at which time it goes out again; and coms not in till Rogation Sunday; from that time it goes out until Advent Sunday. But then the doctrin of devils coms in; and it goes not out again till the 23 of January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame is alſo to be ſaid about abſtaining from fleſh in Lent. For this prohibition is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtigmatized by the ſame Apoſtle in the very ſelf-ſame text, as the devils doctrin. And a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to eat fleſh in Lent, cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Byſhops Courts, without a ſum of moneys; and generally to abſtain from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of devils we give an angel, either a gold angel or a ſilver one.</p>
            <p>Truth is; it is no devils doctrin or evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to refrain either from fleſh or marriage, or any way to bridle, and mortifie our carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, which our holy apoſtles have counſelled us carefully to do, but a bleſſed angelical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. For <hi>the angels of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt our Lord, <hi>do neither marry nor are given in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> And the fleſh of bulls and goats neither doth God nor his angels feed on. And both the counſel and practis of Chriſt and his apoſtles
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57771:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>lead us that way. When the <hi>Bridegroom is taken away, then,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall my diſciples faſt;</hi> that is, they ſhall then enter upon their auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life after their ſolemn profeſſion in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, which now in their noviceſhip I will not put upon them, while they are yet weak in faith. Unto thoſe very ſame diſciples he alſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded continence and coelibacy, both by his own example and words of counſel. And devils are all friends to the contrary uncleannes and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.</p>
            <p>But why then are theſe two abſtinencies ſo oppoſite both of them to the devils will and inclination, called by St. Paul <hi>Doctrina daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum;</hi> wheras devils were never known to move any man to thoſe abſtinencies, but rather to the contrary exceſſes, being enemies themſelvs to all cleanlines &amp; temperance? Doth the devil approve of that which our Lord adviſes us to follow? Or does he labour to promote Chriſts counſel and practis? No, in no wiſe. But whatſoever he may pretend of good, he ever does it to ſom evil end, and for ſnares and ſubverſion. He likes not of continence, he loves not temperance, he hates cleanlines. But ſo to praiſe that which himſelf indeed diſlikes, and perſwade men to beleev, that ſuch an act of high vertue and counſel is alſo of ſuch neceſſity, that no man can be a Chriſtian without it. This is one of his demoniacal ſubtilties.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:57771:94"/>
            <p> The Greek hath two ſeveral words to expres thoſe evil ſpirits in general, <hi>Daemonium,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolus,</hi> the one ſpeaks his crafty ſubtilties, the other his malicious will. But we in Engliſh have but one, and it renders properly the laſt. For the old Saxes our forefathers called that evil ſpirit <hi>Deuvill</hi> or <hi>Doill,</hi> which relates to the will or practice. But <hi>Daemonium</hi> or <hi>Daemon,</hi> for which we have no Engliſh word, has a reference to the underſtanding, and to the perverting of it. And it ſignifies <hi>intelligent</hi> or <hi>knowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this doctrin of abſtinence from meats and marriage as things unlawful, is called by St. Paul <hi>doctrina daemoniorum,</hi> the doctrin of <hi>dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> or of thoſe evil ſpirits, not as they are wicked practiſers, but cunning ſeducers; not as they corrupt the will, but delude the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. They hate continence, and never have or will move any man towards it. But if under colour of its excellency, they could once perſwade men to beleev, that ſalvation is not poſſible for married people, as in primitive times of Chriſtianity they did, then have they acted the part of demons or cunning ſeducers indeed, and brought much ruin and diſorder and ſnares upon the Chriſtian world, which, it is indifferent to them, what way it ſuffer, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv a dammage.</p>
            <p>This craft of <hi>demons</hi> conſiſts generally in this, that to make themſelvs and temptations plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57771:95"/>they ſtill advance one ability or vertue, to depreſs another. In primitive times of the Church they exalted that of the right hand, to depreſs the left; in theſe later times they exalt the vertue of the left hand, to depreſs the right. Thus marriage is good, and continence alſo is good; they are both good: Nay S. Paul ſayes, that continence is better, or the vertue of the right hand: For <hi>he that is unmarried only cares,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>how to ſerve God well, and pleas him; but he that is married is ſolicitous for many worldly affairs</hi> concerning his wife and children, and ſo is <hi>diſtracted</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> two wayes. To exalt then the one of theſe two, which are both good things, unto ſuch a monopoly of goodnes and excellency, that the other ſhall be thought unlawful and evil; this is <hi>doctrina daemoniorum,</hi> the doctrin of demons, who were cunning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Thus faith is good, and other works of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, juſtice, and ſobriety, unto which Chriſt and his apoſtles exhort us, are good alſo, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and healthful. He therfor that ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the one, as to evacuate the other, teaches <hi>doctrinam daemoniorum,</hi> the doctrin of demons, who were cunning ſeducers from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Meat is good, and faſting is good; good to eat with thanksgiving; and good in times and occaſions to abſtain. But that man, who ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57771:95"/>exalts the one, as to exclude the other out of Chriſtianity, is a ſeducer, and teaches the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>demons.</hi> So likewiſe doth he, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo highly magnifies free will, as to exclude Gods grace; or ſo defends grace, that he abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes all concurrence of free will unto works of piety and merit, teach both of them equally the doctrin of <hi>demons,</hi> who were cunning ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In a word, not to mention more examples, wherin I might be copious, ſo to commend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, as to make marriage unlawful, is the doctrin of demons, who were cunning ſeducers from the beginning. And ſo again, to ſet up marriage, as to teach continence to be both ſinful and impoſſible, is the doctrin both of demons and devils too, implacable enemies both to truth and continence. And Chriſt is equally crucified between both the theeves.</p>

            <p>Begins to juſtifie the departure or ſchiſme of the Engliſh from the Roman Church, as good and lawful. For <hi>if Schiſme,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be a crime, it lies upon the Church, not which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but which gave the caus of ſeparation, the Roman, not the Engliſh Church: Cauſal ſchiſme, which gives the occaſion, bears all the blame; but formal ſchiſme, which ſeparates from an offenſive ſociety, is an action of neceſsary vertue. Nor can there be,</hi> quoth he, <hi>any neceſsity of communicating
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57771:96"/>with others in wicked actions; but a neceſsity rather of going out of Babylon. Nor does every ſchiſme turn the Church of Chriſt into a ſynagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but only ſchiſme in ſundamentals, which fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi> he ſaith elswhere, <hi>are as clear and perſpicuous to all men, as that twice two make four.</hi> Theſe Sir be his capital aſſertions in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which how little they will ſerve his purpos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Roman Church, he that ſeriouſly reads your book againſt which this reply is made, will ſoon perceiv: But how much they will diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage him before the Presbyterian, Quaker, and other wayes here in England, who ſeparating from our Engliſh Church, do thus juſtifie their ſchiſme, either by mincing the fault, or laying it upon her from whom they have revolted, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovs him well to conſider.</p>

            <p>Endeavours yet more to diminiſh the fault, and juſtifie the ſeceſſion. <hi>Schiſme,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that proceeds from weaknes, in perſons that deſire to know the truth, and endeavour after it, is free from crime.</hi> And again, <hi>External unity is not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Church. And ſchiſme that is contrary to that unity, divides not from Chriſts body in things abſolutely neceſſary to be united, but only in things not ſo neceſſary, as in the ſame liturgies or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies about matters not fundamental, wherein an union is neither neceſſary nor yet poſſible.</hi> This is, I am ſure, the voice of a Presbyterian, and no
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57771:96"/>Prelatick Proteſtant, as Whitby ſpeaks himſelf to be. And if it be indeed the ſence of our Engliſh Church, as her ſpokes-man here would make us beleev it is, then are ſurely our Engliſh Byſhops in charity all obliged, earneſtly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede with his royal Majeſty, who for civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects hath forbidden all meetings out of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Churches and Chappels, that the poor Quaker, who endeavours after truth and light with an innocent and unfeigned heart, may be permitted for religious reſpects to meet at <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> and other ſuch like places, where they may think fit, being now reſolved never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort more to Proteſtant Steeple-houſes, or to any of their liturgies or ceremonies; which communion is neither <hi>neceſſary</hi> unto any unity, any ſubſtantial unity in Chriſts body, nor yet <hi>poſſible;</hi> that they may declare amongſt themſelvs the ſons of light, the power and truth in ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, without impeachment of the wicked.</p>

            <p>Falls again to ſpeak againſt <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which he had battered before in his whole 9 chapter of above 30 pages, and that with as much earneſtneſs here, as if nothing had been yet ſaid of it. But this chapter was written hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſom other hand, which knew not what the former had performed; till coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of the papers to the Preſs, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they might both paſs.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57771:97"/>
            <p> And here all general Councels, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations are diſabled, as deſtitute of any aſſurance of truth. <hi>Is this Infallibility,</hi> quoth he out of Chillingworth, <hi>in the Councel alone, or Pope alone, &amp;c. What ſhall we do, if they run counter, &amp;c. To whom muſt we hearken when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretend to the Popedom, &amp;c. What if the Popes miſdemeanour be the thing to be judged, &amp;c. How can we be aſſured that any one is true Pope, not Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacally ordained, not illegally elected, not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly baptiſed, &amp;c. which are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties propounded by Mr. Chillingworth, not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be reſolved.</hi> This kind of diſcours fills up this whole chapter.</p>
            <p>By vertue of theſe uncertainties, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell, whether Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> be any miniſter or no; or whether he be a Chriſtian, or ſo much as a <hi>Whitby.</hi> If <hi>titulus coloratus</hi> and moral evidence may not ſuffice us, we can be ſure of no authority either ſpritual or civil in this world. And if any one ſhould learn by this wiſe maſter, thus to except againſt the obliging power of acts and decrees of King or Parliament. <hi>Is that power in the King alone, or in the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp;c. What if they run counter &amp;c. What if they ſhould not be rightly choſen, &amp;c.</hi> would he not talk as wiſe as this man and his little Doctor Chillingworth? It ought to ſuffice an honeſt man and a good ſubject, that an authority is ſet over him and peaceably accepted, whom he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57771:97"/>ought indefinily to obey, not only for wrath but conſcience. It is not his part to weaken due loyalty with theſe ſeditious querks and quibbles, <hi>Who can tell whether he be legitimatly begotten, or rightly baptiſed, or legally elected, &amp;c.</hi> Catholiks have as much ground for their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to civil and ſpiritual Superiours, as they have for their obſervance of their own natural father. And I think that is enough. If we had it not promiſed in Goſpel as we have, that Chriſt would preſerv his Church from failing and errour; yet the very beleef we have in his divinity, would naturally infer ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as Catholicks have in the Churches truth.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> underſtands not in whom this infallibility does originally reſide, as I perceiv by his fond interrogatories, nor conſequently what it is If he had ever had the happy hour to read the Syſtem of that learned Doctour <hi>Franciſcus Davenport,</hi> by whoſe light I have lately, Sir, ſince your departure hence to Paris, ſufficiently declared in our Engliſh tongue, all this whole buſines of infallibility, he had ſaved a multitude of idle words drawn out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fanatick Mr. Chillingworth. Catholik Divines may ſeveral wayes defend and declare this buſines of Infallibility, as well as other points of religion, according to their ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and abilities, and may go ſom of them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57771:98"/>ſo far, as to defend even an intrinſecal inherent Infallibility either in the Pope or Councel. And although this may ſuffer more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then the extrinſecall one of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and guidance, yet do I not ſee how any one can diſprove a poſſibility of it. However faith does not require ſo much at their hands. If God be but infallible, and Chriſt be true, the Church is ſafe.</p>
            <p>Very many bitter books have been written againſt Catholiks and their religion, injuriouſly diminiſhing both them and it, upon the miſtake of this one buſines of Infallibility, perhaps a wilful one; two very lately by Mr. <hi>Moulin</hi> and <hi>Denton,</hi> to the great hurt and dammage of the innocent, if men beleev them. It is a very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good rule, that of the Canon and civil law, <hi>Cum ſunt jura partium obſcura, reo faven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt potius quam actori.</hi> But I doubt much whether the people of England, who may read theſe invective books againſt Papiſts, follow that rule or no. <hi>When the right of Parties is obſcure,</hi> ſaith the law, <hi>the defendant is rather to be favoured than the plaintiff.</hi> If it were ſo here, we ſhould not have been by ſuch bitter books, ſo highly incenſed, as I ſee we are, againſt poor Catholiks; but againſt thoſe rather who ſlander them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moulin would prove, that Catholik re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and not Proteſtancy, is guilty of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57771:98"/>and he does it by <hi>a relation of paſsionate words and actions of ſome Popes recorded in ſtories.</hi> And this he takes to be a ſufficient proof that Catholik religion is guilty of ſedition. It were indeed to be wiſhed, that all Popes words and actions were anſwerable to their religion and rule. But that is hardly to be expected in this world. The very place, and honour that has ever been given to that ſeat, is no ſmall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pride, or other paſſions incident ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into a mind not more then ordinarily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all Chriſtian vertues. But if we will beleev hiſtories concerning them, we ſhall find no ſeries or ſucceſſion of men in any one place or dignity of this world, to have held forth ſo many lights of vertue, as that one chair hath don. And if ſom have been faulty, they gave no doubt much caus of grief or ſcandal, but none of wonderment to the world. They may ſurely fail in a greater temptation; ſince other Chriſtians who have the ſame means of grace, do fail in leſſer. But <hi>Catholiks,</hi> ſaith Mr. Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, <hi>are bound by the very tenour of their religion to hold for good and juſtifie, all that any of their Popes have ever ſaid or don.</hi> This would be very ſtrange, why ſo? Becaus, ſaith he, they beleev them infallible. Who beleevs them infallible? How infallible? that they can neither do nor ſpeak amiſs? Who ever thought that? <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is a word taken up lately by ſchoolmen, to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57771:99"/>expres the ſovereign power and indeficiency of Gods Church, and not any inherent endowments of a Pope, who is brought up when he is young, like one of us, in the Catechiſe and practice of Chriſtian religion, and when he is ripe and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Gods providence in that ſupream chair is eminently to practiſe thoſe holy ruſes, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to keep and maintain that <hi>depoſitum fidei,</hi> the treaſury of faith which he hath received; and if he fail therin, ſhall give an account and ſuffer for it in another world, as ſeverely as any other for their faults: Nor are his words and actions a rule to other men of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Chriſtian religion is a rule to him both for his actions and words. And all that Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which Catholik writers, to expres more than one thing in one ſhort word, make uſe of in their diſcourſes with Proteſtants, is only an extrinſecal providence of God watching over his Church, to preſerv the primitive apoſtolik ſpirit in her, and to keep her alwayes even to the conſummation of the world from errour and deficiency, notwithſtanding any oppoſition from without, or the miſdemeanours of any one or other within her ſelf; even the providence of that good God, whoſe property it is not only to prevent evil from the good, but even to work good out of evil; that his Church which he hath promiſed to preſerv may be ever ſafe. And if ever this infallible providence do ſhow it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57771:99"/>ſelf, it muſt ſurely be then, when the ſhip is ready to be ſplit by hereſies and ſchiſmes, that riſe from ſom violent ſpirits breaking unity with that body ſo dangerouſly, that Prelates are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together from all parts of the world as a help extraordinary, in a general Councel to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ruin. And this is that which Divines mean, when they ſay, that the Pope is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> in the Chair, that is to ſay, <hi>in conſeſſu Seniorum &amp; Presbyterorum eccleſiae,</hi> in a general convention of Chriſtian Prelates. So that Moulin ſpeaks not one word to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</p>
            <p>But Doctour Dentons book is not any ſuch miſtake, but pure malice. He intends to ſhow, <hi>that Papiſts were never puniſhed for religion, but for treaſon.</hi> And his book is altogether made up of ſeveral ſtories of men, Papiſts men, ſent over hither from beyond ſeas, as he ſayes, to kill, poiſon, and deſtroy people. Some, when they had read his book, took the Authour for a fool; but I heard afterwards, that he is Phyſician. And upon that account I had him excuſed. For if he be as bad at phyſick, as he is in affairs of religion, he had caus to be angry with them, who came hither from forreign parts, to take his office and emploiment out of his hands, kill and poiſon people. If the villains, who ever they were, had been only ſent over to make folks ſick, they had don him ſom ſervice; but to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57771:100"/>poiſon men, and kill them down-right, that may give the Phyſician a juſt caus of wrath againſt thoſe intruding empyricks. He begins his book thus. <hi>I ſuppoſe it is a matter of faith with all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that the Pope is infallible, and that he can depoſe Kings, &amp;c.</hi> Thus doth that wiſe man open his mouth and begin his <hi>Recipe.</hi> Two things very ſeldom ſeen in any Academick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, when ſtudents defend a whole body of divinity in the ſchools, but never delivered in Goſpel or declared in Councels, or heard or thought of by any one Catholik in the world, as any thing of his religion, theſe Mr. Denton ſuppoſes to be matter of faith with all Papiſts. I would ask Mr. Denton, whether he thinks it a matter of faith among Papiſts, <hi>That the earth moves,</hi> or no. If one Catholik hold thoſe two aſſertions, which in his ſence I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one do or no: I will be bold to ſay, a thouſand hold this. The next book Dr. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton writes againſt Papiſts, will haply begin thus: <hi>I ſuppoſe it is a matter of faith with all Papiſts, that the earth moves.</hi> And then he may go on with his moon-ſtories, and build caſtles in the air, and Dentoniſe, as here he hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ch.</hi> 21. <hi>from p.</hi> 448. <hi>to</hi> 456.</p>
            <p>Allows that general Councels, although they be not infallible, are highly <hi>notwithſtanding, both themſelvs and their decrees to be eſteemed;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57771:100"/>provided that they keep to Gods rule; that clear reaſon be not againſt them; that men of worth do not gainſay them; and that their proceedings be legal. Not otherwis.</hi> Thus he recalls himſelf and mends the matter. All theſe four things, if ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels obſerv, they ſhall be obſerved themſelves, notwithſtanding they may haply be a company of baſtards and buffoons, neither legitimately begotten, nor rightly baptiſed, nor validly elected, nor legally ordained. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſpecified conditions be, or be not in councels and their decrees, every man, as Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by here and ſeveral other places of his book ſpeaks, is to judg according to his own pleaſur and diſcretion. So that according to his rule, the diſcretion and will of particular men is the final reſolv of all religion, faith, and practis. Whence it will follow, that if there be as many religions as men, they muſt be all good.</p>
            <p>When you object Sir, that ſuch a liberty as this will be deſtructive even of all articles, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and acts of Parliament, in order to our eſtabliſht Proteſtancy or other affairs. To this Whitby replyes according to his cuſtom, very hotly. <hi>Doth it becom a confuter of Mr. Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thus to trifle? Hath he not told you that others may make the ſame defence as we? as murderers may cry not guilty, as well as innocent perſons; but not ſo juſtly, not ſo truly.</hi> For Gods ſake who trifles here? when both <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:57771:101"/>and <hi>Whitby</hi> too, had put into every private mans hand an equal power of judging, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or rejecting the decrees, orders, and laws of their ſuperiours, he now diſtinguiſhes with <hi>Chillingworth</hi> his fanatick Maſter, that ſom do it juſtly and truly; others not ſo juſtly, not ſo truly. But who ſhall paſs judgment upon the final and only irrefragable judg, or aver ſuch a thing of any one, who hath an equal and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power beforehand, to take and reject what himſelf pleaſes. Both truth and juſtice muſt ſolely be in his will, who may admit and refuſe as himſelf willeth.</p>
            <p>But the party now eſteemed faulty will be meal-mouthed we muſt think, and not dare to ſay, he both truly and juſtly does what he does; or to affirm, that he uſes his own diſcretion, in that which he takes or refuſes by his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The Proteſtant forſooth, ſeparated from the Roman, both truly and juſtly: but the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Independent and Quaker, theſe refuſe the Proteſtants communion, not ſo truly, not ſo juſtly, although they do it upon the ſame right and title, and by the ſame principles the other uſed himſelf, and allows to other men. The Proteſtant ſhall reject the Parliament of Prelates, who eſtabliſht Catholik religion, and do it juſtly and truly, only for this reaſon, that they do it upon their own diſcretion; but another if he ſhall except againſt a Council of Lords
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57771:101"/>and Commons, that ſhall ſet up Prelate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, although according to <hi>Whitby</hi> they be no judges of our faith, he does it not ſo juſtly, not ſo truly, though he do it by his own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion allow'd him to be his final reſolv. What is this but to do wickedly, and talk fondly? Firſt to ſubjugate all degrees of autority to every mans judgment, as the final and laſt rule; and then to queſtion that rule, which he made ſubject unto nothing.</p>
            <p>But that we may underſtand what a worthy reſpect Mr. Whitby has for general Councels, he tells us here, <hi>that it is neither impoſſible nor improbable that general Councels may erre. Nay our writers,</hi> quoth he, <hi>do not acknowledg generall Councels to be infallible even in fundamentals.</hi> And Whitby writes, we all know by this time, what his writers writ before him.</p>
            <p>I cannot but marvel at this his talk. For Whitby in ſeveral places of his book affirms himſelf, that fundamentals are ſo perſpicuous and clear, that no man can be ſo ignorant, if he be not a natural fool, as to miſtake therin. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he p. 104, <hi>diſtinguiſh between points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and not fundamental. Theſe are clearly revealed, and ſo of neceſſary beleef. And to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their ſence, there is no more need of a judg, then for any other perſpicuous truth. What need of a judge to decide whether ſcriptur affirms that there is but one God, that this God cannot lye, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57771:102"/>Jeſus Chriſt was ſent by his commiſſion into the world, that he was crucified and roſe again, that without faith and obedience we cannot com to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Theſe and ſuch like are the truths which we entitle fundamental. And if the ſence of this needs an infallible judg, then let us bring Euclids elements to the bar, and call for a judg to decide whether twice two make four.</hi> So he likewiſe avers, p. 441. <hi>that fundamentals are as perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as if they were written by a ſun-beam.</hi> He reckons not the Trinity amongſt his fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; perhaps he does not take it for one; or will have no fundamentals, but what are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
            <p>I could make it eaſily appear, that even fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals have been denied; and that with as great reaſon, as any he calls otherwis, are deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now. But I muſt be brief. That which I here note is this; What is as perſpicuous as a ſun-beam, as certain as Euclids elements, as evident as that which is moſt clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as notorious a known truth, as that twice two make four, ſo clear that there needs no judg to determin it; This the Prelates of the Chriſtian world met together, which none but a natural fool can miſtake, muſt not be able to diſcern. They and none but they, can erre in fundamentals.</p>
            <p>And yet, which does not a little encreas our admiration, he acknowledges withall p. 439.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57771:102"/>
               <hi>That general Councels have</hi> 1 <hi>a greater aſsiſtance of the Spirit of God,</hi> 2 <hi>greater means of finding out the truth,</hi> 3 <hi>better reaſon of diſcovering what is the opinion of the whole Church,</hi> 4 <hi>an authority dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from Chriſt to decide controverſies.</hi> After all this, and with all this, it is neither impoſſible with him, nor unprobable, that general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels may erre, even in fundamentals, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affirms as perſpicuous, as if they were writ with a ſun-beam, as clear and evident as that twice two make four. Prelates, Chriſtian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, theſe muſt be the only natural fools of the world.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This whole chapter might well have been ſpared.

But Mr. Whitby is deſirous, that all ſhould be made plain, and not any rub lie in the Presbyterian and good Quakers way, when he ſhall plead an excuſe for his ſeparation from a Metropolitan Church here in England, which he hath made with a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57771:103"/>judgment of diſcretion here allowed him.</p>

               <hi>Sayes that the Proteſtant never ſeparated from the internal communion of the univerſal Church, which unity is only eſſential, but only from external union with ſom. And ſuch an union external with any Church on earth, is no wayes neceſſary to any ones being a member of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then is the poor Quaker ſo grievouſly perſecuted, impriſoned, and beaten, only for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from an external communion with other Proteſtants? Eſpecially ſince he ſeparates from it, for no other end, but to have the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion in pure faith, and light, and grace, and charity, more perfect. Let any man read the Quakers books, which are now not a few, and ſee if they ſpeak not for themſelvs, as <hi>Whitby</hi> here does for his own caus.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the profeſt errours of the Roman Church juſtifie the Proteſtant ſeparation.</hi> And does not the Quaker juſtifie his ſeparation both from Roman and Proteſtant too by the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of notorious abuſes, errours, ſins, falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſorders, ſuperſtitions, exceſſes, of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, prieſts, byſhops, deanaries, chapters, lawn ſleeves, univerſities and ſteeple-houſes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And that ſupream power I hope then may be permitted to ſet up the Presbyterian or Quaker, at leaſt to give them freedom of Conſcience, if himſelf pleas, without any biſhops conſent, no man daring to gain-ſay or murmur againſt it, which not a few do heartily wiſh to ſee in this Land.</p>

            <p>Thus have you, Sir, the particular deſign of each ſeveral chapter of Mr. <hi>Whitby's</hi> book; the negative part wherof denies your Church, and the poſitive betrayes his own. Why he gainſayes yours, it is not hard to read. But why he ſhould ſo much endanger his own, I cannot ſo eaſily ſay, whether it be ignorance, malice, or neceſſity moves him to it. Surely no Son of the Engliſh Church, as Whitby profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be, could thus open a gap for the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ſects, who are now ready to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her up, if he be in ſound ſences, but he muſt either not have what he may, or not will what he ſhould, or not know what poſitively he ought, to affirm and teach for her better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. This book of Whitbies can never bring any man to that Church; nor keep any in that is there. If an enemy attempt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a hous, it may chance to ſcape. But
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57771:104"/>if the owner and inhabitant begin once to pull it down himſelf, he that paſſes by may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably conjectur it will not long ſtand. Well may the Church of England take up that heavy complaint againſt this her either ignorant or malicious ſon. <hi>If an enemy had don me miſchief, I could have endured it. And if one who openly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted had maligned me, I could have kept my ſelf from him. But thou man! thou my intimate friend! thou my leader and acquaintance!</hi> Thus unworthily to be betrayed by her own <hi>White boy,</hi> muſt be no ſmall aggravation to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſorrow.</p>
            <p>I might eaſily gather out of <hi>Whitbies</hi> own words, conſequently put together, a compleat play for all the ſeveral wayes that are now of late riſen up againſt our Engliſh Church; even ſo compleat, that they never have nor ever need to ſay more. This ſad fate accompanies errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, that even in defending they deſtroy themſelvs.</p>
            <p>If witty Presbyterians aſſiſted him in his book, they did their own work not his. And if he did it himſelf by ſom Presbyterian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, received accidentally from them, he hath don therby not his own work, but theirs.</p>
            <p>Notable is this Gentlemans art in citing of authorities, which he does in moſt of his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, againſt the points of catholik beleef, which are either not expreſſed in his book,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57771:104"/>where they may be found; or not there found, where they are expreſt; or expreſs no ſuch thing, as he cites them in his book to utter. I had in my chamber but one of thoſe many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which Whitby cites for himſelf: and I found in it all this to be true. But this Sir, to ſpare here partly the mans modeſty, and partly my own pains and expence of time, I now omit. And indeed, what would it avail, to give you or the world to underſtand, that Whitby never read the authors himſelf cites, or underſtood not, or wilfully wreſted them. Let him live and learn. And God give him grace to make uſe of his time, to his own advantage.</p>
            <p>This thing I may aſſure you of, that Whitby is an enemy not only to Catholiks, but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants alſo of all profeſſion, here in England: or if you had rather have me ſo ſpeak, an equal friend to all. For he will not have the Church of Chriſt to be any <hi>organical body,</hi> as he calls it, or company of people linked together in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, lyturgy, beleef, and government; but to be only ſuch and all ſuch people, who hold God and a life to com, and ſom other funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, which he names not himſelf, all of them: and therfor, as I ſuppoſe, leavs unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, each man as he pleaſes, to determin. Nor will he have men bound either to an internal beleef, or any exteriour conformity to any Church. This himſelf avers in many ſeveral
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57771:105"/>places of his book, that we may not miſs his meaning. This new way of his I think he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of ſom French Hugonots. For all the wayes that be here now in England concur each one unto a body, an organical body; not only Roman Catholiks, but our Engliſh Prelacy and Presbyterians too. Yea, the very Quakers to my knowledg eſteem none to be ſo much as Chriſtians, who aſſemble not with them. And they have with them ſom miniſters of the goſpel too, though extemporary ones.</p>
            <p>A wary reader may obſery, by the ſole mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of this book of Whitbies, which is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of moſt of the chief authors that have written againſt Popery, ſince the Reformation, how unſettled all Proteſtants be in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points of religion, wherof ther is not any one by ſom of them denied, but is by ſom others of them affirmed. They know what Church to oppoſe; but how much of her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin they ſhould evacuate, they could never yet unanimouſly agree, nor what anſwer to fix ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to any Catholik ground.</p>
            <p>He will find alſo amongſt other things, that our preſent Proteſtants now adayes do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſwerv from the firſt reformers, almoſt in all points both of diſciplin and faith; about ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, good works, free will, poſſibility of keeping Gods commands, the real preſence, prayer for the dead, tradition, &amp;c. which former
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57771:105"/>Proteſtants for the firſt forty years would not abide to hear of; but now they are all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo allowed by moſt Proteſtants, that there appears little difference between their way and catholik faith; but only, that this ſtands unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the other may alter again to morrow. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every Proteſtant writer is in one thing or other a new reformer, as Whitby is here. And every half-ſcore years brings forth new ſcenes; nor is there any now that heeds any Proteſtant writer that is gon, if he ſpeak contrary to him, though he were never ſo eminent, even in the very point and buſines of Reformation. This is enough for Whitby.</p>
            <p>I heard Sir above half a year ago, that Dr. Barlow had made ready for the Preſs another book of his own againſt Mr. Creſſy: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for deteined this my letter with me, till I might give you an account of his with it. Truly Sir, I watched as earneſtly for it, as any cat watches for a mous. But it will not yet appear. In the interim, one Mr. Stillingfleet has lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a great book againſt Popery, even ſo big a book in folio, that none may buy it, but only ſuch as hate Popery more than they love ſixteen ſhillings. And he alſo proceeds this new french Hugonot way, inſiſted on by Whitby. He is only for a Church diffuſive, that holds funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals what ever they be, and makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any Church organical. Wherby he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57771:106"/>utterly diſables not the Roman Hierarchy only, but even our Engliſh Proteſtant Church and government; if men do but underſtand what he ſayes. And yet this man is mightily applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Engliſh byſhops: which I cannot but marvel at; and do thence conclude, that they all begin now to think, our Engliſh Church it ſelf, that it may be made good, muſt be pulled down. Councels he holds with Whitby, that they can have no autority to move our aſſent, although they be general, as ther has never been any he ſayes, theſe thouſand years. And what is ther then for Gods ſake ſhall move the Presbyterians, Independents, and others here in England to approve of the conſtitutions and government of our Engliſh Church, ſet up by a far leſſer aſſembly.</p>
            <p>In a word, this whole book of Stillingfleets is a large diſcours againſt a Theological argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Catholik diſputant. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſeems was this; <hi>Chriſtian faith cannot be divine, except it have its birth from an infallible propoſer; and conſequently the Church muſt either be infallible, or els our faith is not divine.</hi> The anſwer of this argument is the very life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Mr. Stillingfleets whole book. That ſame argument of the Catholik Gentleman is indeed a pretty theological ratiocination: and Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets anſwer, evaſions, and diſtinctions, both concerning the argument in general, and all the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57771:106"/>particulars it runs into are not unwitty. But this is no part of our buſines. Alas we in our controverſies about religion are not come thus far. Such a diſcours had been handſomly fitted to theologicall ſchools, and very proper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt learned divines there: but here not ſo: What is it to our buſines in hand, whether faith can or cannot be divine, except the propoſer be infallible, and as it were divine. This is a meer theological diſpute. And he that anſwers Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleets book, defends not faith immediately, but an argumentators ſyllogiſme. Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as ſoon as ever it is queſtioned or diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, runs preſently into Philoſophy. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if great heed be not taken, it is quite loſt. And thence it comes to paſs, that moſt part of our controverſie books is about ſchool phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and human reaſonings. I blame not the Catholik Gentleman, who ever he was, for his argumenting. Nor will Stillingfleet be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for defending his place. But I let my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, ſpectators of the conteſt, underſtand, that in deed and truth, ſo often as we diſpute, we are beyond the buſines. All writers of controverſie ſpeak more then faith, when they either defend or oppoſe it. And in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controverſies we ſee not ſo much the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the faith, as the wit of him who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or defends it; and ſo much this ſome times, that the other is nothing at all diſcerned.</p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:57771:107"/>
            <p> This the world muſt know and underſtand well; or els they will be miſerably miſtaken, as indeed I ſee all men are. When two lawyers plead about a caſe of right, perhaps three hours together; all that three hours talk is not law, or the right they talk of, but only their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations about it. And ſuch are all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about religion. And he does beſt therin, who ſtill puts his adverſary in mind what is his talk, and what is the faith they talk of. But he that defends both of them equally, forgets himſelf. And thus I ſee that generally men do miſcarry on both ſides: the Proteſtant by calling that Romaniſh doctrin, which is but a Catholiks diſcours for it; and the Catholik by maintaining that talk of his, which it is not a pin matter whether it ſtand or fall. For faith is firm and conſtant, though all my talk for it be miſerably weak.</p>
            <p>Now all the whole buſines of faith, which Stillingfleet and his adverſary talk of, is, as I take it, only this; <hi>That the Church of Chriſt hath by Gods divine promis of being ever with her, a power to oblige her ſubjects to hear and obey her, if they mean to be happy in their way.</hi> The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik affirms this: Stillingfleet with his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants deny it. And this is all the faith that is in it: which is not here touched. And a theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical buſines of Infallibility only ſpoke of. And therfor Stillingfleet is much to blame, when he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57771:107"/>ſpeaks ſo often in his book, of <hi>the Romaniſts way of reſolving faith; the Romaniſts arguments for their faith; the Romaniſts doctrin about infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not divine, but as it were divine; the Romaniſts tenet about fundamentals; the Romaniſts motives of credibility; the Romaniſts doctrin about the material and formal object of faith, &amp;c.</hi> For all this and ſeveral ſuch like talk is but the theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical diſcours of that Catholik Gentleman, and of it ſelf no Romaniſts doctrin at all. For I know well enough what Stillingfleet means, and would have meant by <hi>Romaniſts doctrin.</hi> And all his Proteſtant readers underſtand therby on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholik religion: and he knows it well enough.</p>
            <p>I ſhould take it ill and be ſorry, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as an injury to the Church of God, if any one ſhould call my way of defending her faith, <hi>the Romaniſts way;</hi> or my talk, <hi>the Romaniſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin:</hi> however the thing it ſelf defended or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by me is Roman or Catholik faith. The Church has no one way, but ſeveral methods, and ſeveral ſchools, and ſeveral wayes to declare and explicate, and defend her religion. And every writer does it according to his perſonall endowments and judgment; ſome better, ſome wors, though the religion ſo explicated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and declared be ſtill and ever, one and the very ſame. And if indeed I had been to ſpeak in that buſines, I ſhould never have made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57771:108"/>any ſuch argument as that Catholik Gentleman did: nor will another man think himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to diſcours as I do, although he and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend both of us the ſame thing. This if Mr. Stillingfleet conſider as he ought, he will ſoon perceiv his own pittiful childiſhnes. But thus Doctour OeN dealt with me to my very great pitty and regret. Ever and anon, <hi>Is this your Roman doctrin,</hi> quoth he? <hi>Who would have thought, that the Romiſh Church ſhould dare to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo wicked blaſphemies,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting my words, and calling that a doctrin which was none at all, but only a proſopopy of atheiſtical objections; and then ſtiling that a Roman doctrin, which was but the talk of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man. So that what he called Roman doctrin, and Romiſh doctrin, was neither Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh nor doctrin neither. But miniſters care not what they ſay. And ſo much the more wary does it behove all men to be, who deal with them. Too much care cannot be taken with ſuch men, who either cannot or will not diſtinguiſh between general faith and particular mens doctrin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween religion, and ſeveral ſchool-methods of defending it; between the faith of the whole Church of God, and diſcourſes of writers concerning it. So ignorant they are all of them, or wilfully malicious. I find in my heart even a longing deſire to expres to you in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the various ſhifts and miſdemeanours of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57771:108"/>Stillingfleet. But here is now no time or place for it; and ſuch a thing if it were done, would be but of little uſe to morrow. I mention him only, to let you know, how much the French Hugonot religion begins here to prevail by means of Whitby, Stillingfleet, and others, to the overthrow of our own Proteſtant Church here eſtabliſht; and to let poſterity, who ſhall haply ſee any of theſe ſmall writings, have ſome little glimmerings of theſe our preſent times. They doubtles will be glad to ſee the general cours of things now done, even as we are to read the wayes of former reformers: although neither we nor they can take any great pleaſur in any long particular narrations of their fallacies either againſt logick or morality, when the men are once paſt and gone.</p>
            <p>Dr. Jeremy Taylor hath alſo put forth lately a very bitter, inſulting, injurious book againſt Catholik religion, which he calls a <hi>Diſſwaſive from Popery. Reddet illi dominus ſecundum opera ejus.</hi> And God will bleſs his Catholik beleevers who truſt in him, and walk according to their holy rule, in his fear and love, unblamable, the very contumelies of adverſaries working at length to their greater good. And I beſeech God, who revives all things, and Jeſus our Lord, who gave his teſtimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confeſſion, that they may ever obſerv the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and the Church his Spous,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57771:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>poſſeſſing their ſouls in perfect patience, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable unto the coming of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, whom in his own times will the bleſſed God ſhew forth, the only potent one, the King of kings, and Lord of Lords, who alone hath immortality, and inhabits light inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whom no mortal man hath ever ſeen, nor yet can ſee him; to whom be all honour, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion and power for evermore.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu were pleaſed to ſay, upon your reading of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> that Popery may, for ought you knew, be more innocent then commonly it is reputed, and no wayes ſo odious as ſome would make it. But now, upon the reading of Dr. Taylor's Diſſwaſive, which you deſire me to peruſe, I perceiv you look towards your former thoughts concerning this maligned. Popery, and invite them home again. To deal freely with you, I was amazed my ſelf at the reading of that book, though not Sir with your amazement, but another of my own. You ſtartled at Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whoſe uglines was there ſet before your eyes with ſuch freſh colours. I at thoſe ugly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which ſo injuriouſly defaced that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that moſt innocent Religion, which under the name of Popery lies here traduced by the pen of her own ungrateful Scribe.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! What; Doctour Taylor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery? And ſuch a Diſſwaſive as this! But my amazement, Sir, is now blown over. The
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57771:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>Doctour appeared to me after ſome ſerious thoughts, to be for a ſpecial reaſon, that touches none ſo much as himſelf, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner excuſable. That none ſhould love Popery, or ever come to know it, concerns not only his wealth and dignity, and life of eaſe, which is the common caus of others alſo with himſelf, but all the honour and fame he hath hitherto got by tranſcribing popiſh, as now he calls, but in former times named Catholik, authors. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bin twenty years and upwards deeply plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in reading and tranſcribing ſom of the in-numerous ſpiritual books, that are amongſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, not only in Latin, but other languages of ſeveral Kingdoms where that Religion flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, he hath culled out thence many fine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, which he hath ſet forth in his own name and language, to his much renown, and no ſmall wealth and dignity amongſt us. Nor is it to be doubted, but that he means for his yet further glory, reaped from other mens labours, and that ſpirit of piety which thence he got into his own pen, to write out yet one book more. The ſame ſtore-houſe that furniſhed him with the life of Chriſt, will dictate to him alſo the lives of his twelve Apoſtles, and many other raptures of divine love, and heavenly devotion. And if people be but kept from Popery, as he hopes and labours they may, it will never be known, whence he gathers thoſe his fragrant pieties. It
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57771:111"/>was not handſom, yet a piece of wiſdom it was in the Grecian Cynick, to ſpit in the diſh which pleaſed him beſt, leſt others ſhould taſte how good it was, and deprive him therby of ſom of his content.</p>
            <p>This book of Doctour Taylors called a <hi>Diſſwaſive,</hi> printed in Dublin, and as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, reprinted here in London, (I ſuppoſe in the very ſame words by reaſon of the Authors abſence) is large enough, containing 173 pages in quarto, marvellouſly bitter, and contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſulting over that Religion, which he cannot but know he miſreports. Indeed, Sir, there is more popery in one page of Dr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors <hi>Life of Chriſt,</hi> which he tranſcribed from popiſh Authors, than is in all this whole book which he writes againſt thoſe Authors popery: that is owned by them to be their religion; all this he puts upon them under the notion of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, throughout his whole hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three pages, except haply ſom three or four words, whoſe ſence alſo he perverts, no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik upon earth acknowledges for any parcel of his faith. Is not this ſtrange diſingenuous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How he comes to act thus, and what is the feat he makes uſe of, to diſcolour their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you ſhall hear by and by, when I have firſt opened his book, and the things contained in it.</p>
            <p>His Diſſwaſive hath three chapters, and each
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57771:112"/>chapter ſeveral ſections.
<list>
                  <item>The firſt chapter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled thus; <hi>The Doctrin of the Roman Church in the controverted articles is neither Catholik, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolik, nor Primitive.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The ſecond thus; <hi>The Church of Rome as it is at this day diſordered, teaches doctrins, and uſes practices, which are in themſelvs, or in their true and immediat conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, direct impieties, and give warranty to a wicked life.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The third thus; <hi>The Church of Rome teaches doctrins, which in many things are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of Chriſtian ſociety in general, and of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in ſpecial: both which the Religion of the Church of England and Ireland, does by her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins greatly and Chriſtianly ſupport.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> Theſe three be things of importance, and muſt either be great notorious crimes in the Defendant, or monſtrous ſlanders in the Plaintiff. A Religion that is new, impious, and unſociable; that is againſt antiquity, piety, and ſociety, is hardly good enough for Hell. Who is he that ſhall dare to profeſs or countenance ſuch a religion upon earth. But let us ſee in order how all this is demonſtrated to us by an old, pious, and ſociable Doctour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His firſt Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then; <q>That the doctrin of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church in the controverted Articles is neither Catholik, Apoſtolik, nor Primitive, he declares in eleven ſections, which make up that his firſt chapter. Firſt ſection ſayes, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57771:112"/>the Roman Church pretends a power to make new Articles of faith, and doubtles uſes that power, and for that end corrupts the Fathers, and makes expurgatory Indices to alter their works. The ſecond, that this power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new articles is a novelty, and yet beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Papiſts. Third, that the Roman doctrin of Indulgences is unknown to antiquity. Fourth, that Purgatory is another novelty. Fift, Tranſubſtantiation another. Sixt, Half-communion another. Seventh, Liturgy in an unknown tongue another. Eighth, Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Images the like. Ninth, Pictures the ſame. Tenth, the Popes general Epiſcopacy likewiſe. And the eleventh and laſt ſpeaks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many more all of a heap, to make up his one laſt ſection; as Invocation of Saints, ſufficiency of ſcriptures, abſolving ſinners before pennance, ſimple Prieſts giving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, ſelling Maſſes for nine pence, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgeſtation of the Euchariſt, intention in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Maſs-ſacrifice, and ſupper without Communion. All this is Popery, all new, and therfor the Roman Church is neither Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik, Apoſtolik, nor Primitive.</q> This is the ſum of his firſt Chapter.</p>
            <p>What in the name of God does this Author of the <hi>Diſſwaſive,</hi> your learned Doctour, mean by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the <hi>doctrin</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> This Sir, is a main buſines,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57771:113"/>and ought, if he had meant ſincerity, to have been firmly ſtated, before any thing were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either of the one or the other. But this he utterly here omits, which he ſhould principally have heeded, that he may ſpeak looſely and hand over head, any thing he may deem fit to black his own paper and other mens fame. If he take them as he ought; the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> for that univerſality of Catholik beleevers, who live in ſeveral kingdoms of the world united in faith and ſacraments under the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and one viſible Paſtour; and <hi>the doctrin of that Church,</hi> for the body of faith and religion handed to them from age to age, as taught and delivered from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which they call in the phraſe of St. Paul <hi>Depoſitum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi> or treaſure of faith: I ſay if he mean this by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and <hi>doctrin of that Church,</hi> as he ought to do, I will be bold to aver, that ther is not any one claus or period in his book true, and three parts of his book abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. If he mean otherwis then Catholiks themſelvs conceiv or profeſs, he was bound in honour to make his mind known, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of an innocent Religion, and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might not ſuffer prejudice by his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous ſpeech. But perhaps he ſtudied how to abuſe that Religion, that he may be thought worthy of the dignity and wealth he has now obtained in another, ſlipt our of it. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57771:113"/>the way he takes to villifie the Roman faith and Church, which is indeed the comm on road of all her adverſaries, I ſhall ſpeak more fully, if I have time, by and by. Now I haſten to his text, which I ſhall give, and my own judgment of it very briefly.</p>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>Which is about Novelties in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that the Proteſtant hath the word of God, and Goſpel, and Apoſtles writings, and if need be, the four firſt general Councels, and cannot be therfore doubted to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical; but the Roman Church cannot ſo much as pretend, that all her Religion is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, ſince ſhe pretends a power of making new articles of faith: for Turrecremata, Triumphus, Ancorano, and Panormitan af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſhe can do it. And this power Pope Leo the tenth challenged, when he condemned Luther for denying him to have it. To fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this their pretended power, the Papiſts corrupt, and alter the Fathers works: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Saurius the correctour of the Preſs at Lions, complained to Junius, that he was forced to blot out many ſayings of St. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, which had been in a former edition printed there. For this care of purging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik writers Sixtus Seneſis commends Pope Pius. Nay, they correct the very Indexes made by Printers, as thoſe of Probens and Chevallonius.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57771:114"/>
            <p> Thus the Doctour begins his book: and I cannot but commend his wit. For he wiſely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes that to himſelf, which is the very one great buſines, wherin every particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſticks, and which, if it were once agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, would put an end to all controverſies, that either now are, or ever ſhall be in the world. For they all com at length to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which of the many Profeſſours of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, now ſo much divided in their wayes, have the Goſpel and word of God on their ſide, in this, that, and the other particular. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith Dr. Taylor, <hi>we Proteſtants have the word of God, we have the Goſpel of Chriſt, we have the Apoſtles writings with us and for us, and therfor our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for certain, both ancient, primitive, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical.</hi> This is, Sir, a very good conſequence. That Religion muſt needs be ancient, which hath God for his Author, that muſt be a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtianity which Chriſt founded, and what the Apoſtles writings confirm, muſt needs be Apoſtolical faith. But is it proved here by the Doctour, that Proteſtants and not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks have the word of God and of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles on their ſide? No, it is all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: and his whole endeavour is to tell us, that the religion which iſſued from God and Chriſt, and his holy Apoſtles, muſt needs be Apoſtolical, primitive, and ancient. He ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Proteſtancy, as diſtinct from Catholik faith,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57771:114"/>to have com all of it from thoſe divine hands, which is the only thing to be proved: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares at large, that a religion which came from ſuch hands, muſt needs be ancient and primitive, which is a thing no man can ever doubt.</p>
            <p>It is certain and manifeſtly known, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants received both Law and Goſpel, and Apoſtles writings, from the hands of Roman Catholiks, who had kept and canonized, and lived by thoſe rules fifteen hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Proteſtancy roſe up in the world, and all the whole hundred years ſince. The only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is about the ſence and mind of that holy writ, in the many particular points now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the world. He has the law, that has the mind and purpos and meaning of the law; not he that hath the form of words without it. This is the great buſineſs, and the very extract and quinteſſence of all controverſies: which your quick Doctour aſſumes as granted on his ſide, without any more ado. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we Proteſtants have the Law and Goſpel, and Apoſtles writings, and the old Councels too if need be, and therfor is not the ancientneſs of our Religion to be doubted. But the Papiſts!</hi> what of them? <hi>the Papiſts Religion cannot ſo much as be pretended to be Apoſtolical, old, or primitive.</hi> Why ſo? Have not they the law and Goſpel, and Apoſtolical writings? He does not plainly ſay they have not, but he hopes his reader will think ſo. What
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57771:115"/>then of the Papiſts? <hi>They,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can make new Articles, and therfor cannot their Religion be antient.</hi> Sir, although they could make new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſo long as they do not, their Religion may be old ſtill for all that. A man may live in an old houſe, although he be able to build a new one. And this ſeems indeed to be the caſe here. For the Diſſwader in confirmation of his ſpeech, brings in, although unjuſtly, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſom Catholik Doctours, who ſhould ſay, <hi>The Church can make new Articles;</hi> but not one that ſayes ſhe has made any. That I may yet go further; although the Church ſhould make new obliging Articles: ſo long as theſe do not contrary the former, but declare them more amply in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, they annull not, but rather confirm and explicate the old ones. Is not our Law the ſame old Law of England, and we the ſame polity our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, although the King and Parliament upon occaſion of new diſorders, make new acts and ſtatutes continually? But let us go on, yet one ſtep more.</p>
            <p>The Roman Church does plead, Sir, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Diſſwader would have you think, that her religion is Catholik, Apoſtolik, and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: becaus all her Councels, by which that Church is governed, have openly and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declared, when they came together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide any affair which had raiſed new diſturbance
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57771:115"/>in the Chriſtian world, that they muſt firmly adhere to that which is Primitive, to that which is Apoſtolical, to that which is Catholik, to that which has been delivered and received from fore-fathers. And by that rule they decided the difference. How then can this Church pretend to make new Articles? Does your Doctour bring any General Councel, which is the loud voice of that Church; or any Tradition, which is the Churches ſtill voice, to ſpeak it? No, not any at all. But this he ought to have done, if he would prove that Church to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch power. What then? Wy, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recramata</hi> and ſom other doctours ſayes, <hi>ſhe can do it.</hi> But Sir, if ſome one or other clergy-man ſhould think that the Church can make new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, does it therfor follow, that the Church it ſelf does pretend any ſuch power. Surely the voice of one or two Miniſters here in England cannot in reaſon be thought the voice of our whole Proteſtant Church, eſpecially when they ſpeak againſt the tenour of her doctrin and practice. But your Diſſwader has been many years picking in cobweb holes, and obſcure wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that he might, where he could find any half ſentence apt to be wreſted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgment of Catholik Religion, mark that out for Popery; to the end it may be thought either naught or new. This is the chief ingredient of your <hi>Diſſwaders</hi> Policy. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57771:116"/>Doctours, Sir, though they may have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many other moſt excellent, catholik, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, yet through humane infirmity, in this and that particular, may they at one time or other trip and fail. And particular mens fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are to be rectified by the ſtraightnes and integrity of the General Canon; but they are not to be eſteemed that Canon, as your Doctor Taylor, not inclined to mend things but marre them rather, would here have them to be, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout this whole book of his Diſſwaſive; where whatever he can read or hear of amongſt the writings of any one in the Catholik world, that may either ſwerv or be wreſted from the univerſal judgment and beleef of Papiſts, that he calls Popery: and what they ſpeak, that the Roman Church muſt pretend. O the ſtrange perverſneſs and wickedneſs of mans heart! And yet this book of his thus made up, has carried away, not the weaker ſort of men only, but it ſeems has made even your diſcretion, Sir, to ſtagger. For when I gave you lately a viſit, I perceived within a while, that I had but gon forth to ſee a reed ſhaken with the wind.</p>
            <p>What the Church can do, is but one of the Queſtions of School-divinity, and no Catholik faith: Conſequently no Popery. And if two or three in the Schools ſhould chance to aver this power in the Church, where more then two or three thouſands deny it, why ſhould not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57771:116"/>the opinion of three thouſand Papiſt doctours be eſteemed Popery, as well as that of only three. Whilſt all of them agree in their faith, which is, <hi>that the Church hath a power authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to decide controverſies,</hi> and diſpute only of a further power then their faith reaches unto, I ſhould think, that the opinion of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Papiſt doctours is rather to be eſteemed Popery, if one of them muſt be called ſo, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the ſingle opinion of two or three, if any ſuch be to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But truth is, ther is no ſuch opinion of any one I know to the contrary. Nor does Turre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremata, nor any els teach, that the Church hath power to make new articles, in that ſence your Dr. Taylor means, who therby would infer, that Catholik faith is therfor not primitive, but new. Nay, it is rather Popery, and a part of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik faith, that no new articles can be made. For General Councels have determined, that nothing is to be beleeved or held, but <hi>id quod traditum eſt,</hi> that which has been received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Nor can the Religion otherwiſe be the faith of Chriſt, or Chriſtian Religion. Sir, if you do but ſeriouſly peruſe the laſt one general Council, which all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants hold to be rank popiſh; that I mean which was kept at Trent: you will find that they teſtifie almoſt in every Seſſion, and profes to make all their determinations according to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57771:117"/>that <hi>which had been delivered,</hi> according to that <hi>they had received,</hi> according to that which had <hi>been conſerved by continual ſucceſsion</hi> to that which was <hi>conformable to Apoſtolical tradition,</hi> to that which had been perpetually and <hi>uninterruptedly retained,</hi> to that which <hi>anceſtours profeſt,</hi> to that which the Church of <hi>God ever taught,</hi> ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ever beleeved, that which hath been <hi>received down by hands,</hi> that which was the <hi>ancient judgment,</hi> and cuſtom, that which has been <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> ſince the apoſtles dayes, &amp;c. Theſe are all the very words of the Councel in ſeveral of their Seſſions. And ſhall a Doctor Taylor com now after all this, and tell the world, <hi>that Popery is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholik, Apoſtolik, nor Primitive, and that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts pretend to make new faith,</hi> &amp;c. after a general Synod, which all Proteſtants look upon, as the moſt popiſh Councel that ever was, and that too the laſt and neareſt to us, hath ſo manifeſtly, ſo pathetically, ſo generally profeſt the contrary. What ſhould we ſay to ſuch a Doctor? And other general Councels in like manner, never deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined any thing for the quieting of diſſentions, for which end they met together, but what was latent at leaſt in the ſeed of Chriſts word, and ſo no new article in this Doctours ſence: as did that Councel for example, which determined two wills in Chriſt, which was no new article, becaus the former old faith, which had made known two perfect natures in our Lord, the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57771:117"/>one divine, the other humane, apparently dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that truth againſt all thoſe, who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg but one will in him. And this being defined by the Councel, received a new ſtrength againſt a novel hereſie, but not a new birth. For this caus Councels do not determin the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties that are in Schoolmen; becaus theſe are ſuperſtructures, and none of them more latent in ancient tradition, than is the opinion that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Turrecremata, Triumphus, Ancoran, and Panormitan teach that the Church can make new articles.</hi> If they ſhould ſay any ſuch thing, I have already made it enough evident, that it cannot be thence inferred to be popery, or any part of popery. But what if they ſpeak no ſuch thing? What ſhall we think then of this your Dr. Taylor? <hi>Turrecremata</hi> in the place cited by him, never ſo much as dreamed, as any man may there ſee, that the <hi>Pope is the rule of faith,</hi> as the Doctour would have him ſpeak: but in that whole chapter labours only to ſhew, that it belongs to him principally to <hi>regulate</hi> diſputes in faith, as being the <hi>chief</hi> Prelate. In the like manner does he moſt unworthily abuſe the other three, brought by him as witneſſes, that the Pope can make new Creeds, and new faith: wheras Panormitan teaches expreſly, that he cannot make, but only declare faith; Ancorano ſayes the like, adding that what he ſo declares,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57771:118"/>may be new <hi>to us,</hi> though not <hi>in it ſelf:</hi> and Triumphus no leſs manifeſtly ſpeaks in the very place cited by him, that ther is one and the ſame faith in the ancients and moderns, and that in our holy Creed are inſerted all thoſe things, which univerſally pertain to Catholik faith: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſay withall, which is alſo very true, that to adde, explicate, or declare a truth, which is contained in holy Scripture, hath alwayes been lawful for the Church. But is this to make new faith which is not Apoſtolik, and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as this your Doctour would have them to aſſert? Do you Sir, your ſelf judg. And him that thus abuſes the world, God Almighty judg. So that when we come to the cloſe of all, ther is not any one Catholik Doctour, that ever ſaid that the Church can make new articles of faith in Doctour Taylors ſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why then did Pope Leo the</hi> 10. <hi>condemn Luther for denying the Pope to have this power?</hi> Neither did Luther, or Pope Leo ever dream of any ſuch thing. For Luther wholly buſied himſelf about his old Catholik Religion, from which he had revolted, which he called an Egyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that had overſpread the earth even from the Apoſtles dayes, and never thought of this ſchool queſtion, which in his dayes was not heard of. And he denied the then preſent Pope who was Leo the tenth, to be any judg in thoſe Controverſies of Religion, or to have any
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57771:118"/>power <hi>ſtatuendi,</hi> of deciding or determining in ſuch affairs. Nor is ther any the leaſt mention, either in Luther's reſiſtance, or Leo his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, about conſtituting new articles, but only deciding the old, which Luther would have thought to be erroneous, however ſtrengthened by antiquity, and from which old errours he would make himſelf a reformation and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the right, which was in himſelf not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to any man, no not to the Pope himſelf in thoſe affairs. Is this a miſtake think you in your <hi>Diſſwader</hi> or ſomthing wors? Truly I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think he was ſo ignorant.</p>
            <p>The like inſincerity doth this your <hi>Diſſwader</hi> exhibit in all that his talk of the Catholiks deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Fathers works, and the indexes or tables adjoyned to them, jumbling his words ſo confuſedly together, that his reader might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev that to be don to the Fathers writings themſelvs, which the Churches care provided to be done to the falſe gloſſes, tables and indexes annexed to thoſe writings; and that to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of thoſe writings, which ever was, and ſtill is in them; and Printers and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectours complaining of that fault of making alterations in the Fathers Editions, which they did not ſo much as think of. Which is a moſt ſtupendious inſincerity. And <hi>thus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are the Fathers maimed and curtailed by Papiſts; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Sixtus Senenſis praiſes Pope Pius</hi> 5.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57771:119"/>
               <hi>for this his car ein purging the Fathers works.</hi> I ſay this whole talk of his is moſt prodigiouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. For that Index Expurgatorius extended not to any writings or works of the Fathers, but only to the marginal notes and falſe gloſſes and indexes or tables put to them by the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and therfor are Tertullian, Origen, and ſome others ſtill printed intire, though ther be not a few things in them contrary to Catholik faith. And this the very words of Junius a Correctour of a Preſs cited by the Doctour clearly intimates. <hi>What,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Papiſts dare not do with the Fathers, they practiſe upon us,</hi> he means Proteſtant printers and writers: <hi>and with their little forks thruſt out our annotations in the margent, and our ſayings in the indices, although they be conſonant to the Fathers minds.</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>this care was ſo great in Pius</hi> 5. <hi>that Sixtus Senenſis commends the Pope for his induſtry in purging the Fathers works.</hi> He did ſo indeed: but if the Doctour had ſpoken out the ſentence, he had betrayed his own falſe heart, which he would not willingly do. <hi>Expurgari,</hi> ſaith Senenſis, <hi>&amp; emaculari curaſti omnium Catholicorum Scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ac praecipue veterum Patrum ſcripta, haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum aetatis noſtrae faecibus contaminata &amp; venenis infecta.</hi> Your Doctour our Diſſwader makes Senenſis praiſe the Pope, for his purging the Fathers, as though he had ſcowred and ſcraped off the ſubſtance: whereas he commended him
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57771:119"/>only for his care in cleanſing them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious notes and gloſſes ſuperadded to them by the hereticks of our times.</p>
            <p>But Sir, that I may tell you once for all. The falſifications of Authours perverted by this your Diſſwader, are ſo many, ſo notorious and groſs ones, that in the very relating them I ſhall tire both my ſelf and you. My deſign is only to let you know, that this whole work of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive from Popery,</hi> if the proofs and citations he brings for his talk were true, as they are all falſe, ſignifies nothing at all. Two worthy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Gentlemen have diſcovered by the help of the Libraries in London and Oxford ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt groſs falſifications, one of them a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, the other yet more and greater, that it cannot but amaze an honeſt minded rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to behold them. Pray read them Sir, and ponder ſeriouſly; and ſo rid of that trouble, I ſhall make the more haſte in my own deſign. It was their endeavour it ſeems to ſhow him to be diſhoneſt, mine is only to prove him imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. God reward them for their pains, and help me in mine. For my hand denies me now his office, not able to write with that facility it was wont. But becaus I ſaw no abler pen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as I thought they would in the confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſlanderous book: I judged it my part, Sir, to give you ſom general hints of light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, till there might iſſue ſom more ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57771:120"/>confutation by a better hand. And here, Sir, you muſt know too, that I had no ſooner finiſhed this my Epiſtle, but that I underſtood of another book againſt this Doctour Taylors <hi>Diſſwaſive,</hi> a very ſolid book written by Ja. Ser. in order to his own book called <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> lately ſet forth, which made me doubt for a while, whether I ſhould let this of mine appear; eſpecially when I conſidered the induſtry, care, and ſolidity of thoſe three men; the laſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had ſo taken up what the other two had left for me to ſay, and ſo utterly confounded this Diſſwaſive, that I might well be ſilent. But I remembred a ſtory which I had ſometime read in holy writ, of Joas the King of Iſrael; who coming to viſit Elizeus the Prophet when he lay ſick on his death-bed, was bid by him for his encouragement againſt his enemies, to <hi>ſtrike the ground with the javelin he had in his hand.</hi> Joas at his word ſtruck the floor three times. But the holy man of God was angry with him and ſaid; <hi>If thou hadſt ſtruck five or ſix or ſeven times, thou hadſt ſmote Syria even to an utter conſummation; but now thou ſhalt ſmite it but thrice.</hi> So very faulty is this Diſſwaſive, that it cannot be ſmote too often, even to an utter conſummation.</p>
            <p>§. 2 <hi>Which is about a leaſh of new Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that in the Church of Rome faith and Chriſtianity encreas like the moon: and that ther be now two new articles of faith a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57771:120"/>coining, namely the immaculate Conception, and the Popes being above the Councel: and one other lately produced in the Councel of Trent, ſeſſ. 21. which is, <hi>That although the antient Fathers did give the Communion to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, yet they did not beleev it neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> Which decree is, ſaith he beyond all bounds of modeſty and evident truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here your Doctour tells news of one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle lately made, and two more a coining, which will ſhortly be out of the mint: both which news he knows, but we know not. Indeed Sir, this ſection belongs more to a writer of Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals or weakly Intelligencer, than to a Doctour of Divinity. And therfor at the reading of it, I turned ſuddenly to the frontiſpiece of the book, to ſee whoſe <hi>Imprimatur</hi> it had to it. And I found it licenſed, not by Mr. l' Eſtrange, but Geo. Stradling. Firſt then he tells us news to come, and then news paſt.</p>
            <p>A pair of faith articles are now, he ſaith, in the mint, and will ſhortly come forth. <hi>The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins immaculate Conception, and the Popes being above a Councel.</hi> But how can your Diſſwader ſay, that theſe two are ſhortly to com forth, wheras in this very ſection he tells us a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that the Councel of Baſil decreed the ſecond Article againſt the Pope. And I am ſure, the ſame Councel of Baſil decreed the firſt article of the immaculate Conception,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57771:121"/>ſeſſ. 36. Surely the year of our Lord 1431. when that Councel was kept, is not now to come. Where and when, and how can they be more then they are already? I ſuppoſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies this by reaſon of ſom vehement diſputes about thoſe points. If this be it, he may adde yet five hundred more, which are more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently diſputed than theſe be. One of them it is much he could miſs. For the ſuperiority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King of France and Spain has been often agitated not only by their Embaſſadours in Kingdoms where they reſide, but even in Councels alſo, and that with too much of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency there.</p>
            <p>As concerning the Conception, I know the two ſchools of divine S. Thomas and ſubtile Scotus have much altercation about an inſtant of time, an Ariſtotelical Inſtant, ſo ſwift and ſhort an inſtant, that no thought of man, though never ſo nimble, can ever catch it. And the general Paſtour has ſilenced that School-diſpute, becaus it ſounded ill, and ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What is it to action, or any eſteem to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Bleſſed Virgin, that ſhe was pure in her Conception by Gods preventing grace, as one ſchool ſpeaks, or by his ſanctifying grace, as the other ſchool declares it; that ſhe was ever Immaculate, Gods mercy providing that in no inſtant imaginable ſhe ſhould be liable to original ſin, as Scotus teaches; or Gods grace
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57771:121"/>ſo working, that immediatly after that inſtant ſhe ſhould be made pure and holy, as Saint Thomas ſpeaks. For this is the ſchool diſpute, which your Diſſwader, if he underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, here talks of. And thoſe very Doctours who diſpute this, and all pious Chriſtians have ever unanimouſly beleeved, that the Bleſſed Virgin was not only moſt pure and unſpotted in her whole life, but even from her firſt anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the womb. So that if we ſpeak of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and complete Conception, ſhe is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be Immaculate. And from this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition, wherin Catholiks agree, and are already reſolved, the firſt reforming Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants departed, as well as from many others. Nor in any probability will ever that Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical School inſtant, which ſignifies juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as to any Chriſtian action, be ever thought of: unleſs ſom greater diſorder then I have yet heard of, exact a further deciſion about a thing, which it is not the weight of a hair, whether it be expreſſed according to the ſchool of S. Thomas or of Scotus.</p>
            <p>The like I ſay to that other article, which your Diſſwader propheſies will ſhortly come forth, concerning the <hi>Popes being above a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi> For that ther is, and ought to be, one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſtour over all Chriſts flock upon earth, whether eſſential or repreſentative, is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Tradition; which Catholiks ſtill embrace,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57771:122"/>but Proteſtants have left. And this tradition, together with the former of the immaculate Conception, if your Diſſwader had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhow, either not to have been, or likely not to be perpetual, his endeavour however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, had not been at leaſt impertinent. But inſtead of that, he tells us, that this and that will ſhortly com forth new articles, not heeding that himſelf and ſuch as he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the old.</p>
            <p>And this his propheſie in this, is as vain as in the other. For that the Pope, who is and ever was beleeved the head and Prince of the whole Councel, ſhould be alſo above it, and his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there greater then all the reſt beſide, is a ſpeculative querk, that ambition may think, but ſober reaſon will never deem of moment. For whether he be above the Councel, that is to ſay, of greater authority then all the other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates put together; or not above, but their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority joyned together as great, or greater then his: neither they without him, nor he without them, can poſitively declare any thing with authentick authority, for the ſilencing of differences which ariſe in faith. I'th interim the chief Prelate is for certain above the Councel in this ſence: that he is their Prince and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: as alſo he has in himſelf a negative voice, both with the Councel, and without it. For this is a right ingrafted naturally in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57771:122"/>condition of all whatever ſuperiority, ſpiritual or civil: without which they could not rule or mannage their charge. By it they ſilence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, and end debates, according to the tenour of laws already made, which in ſuch caſes, they are by their place and office to interpret; ſo far at leaſt, that one party ſhall not carry it againſt the other, which he ſhall judge in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances to com nearer to law and right, than he. This power I ſay every ſuperiour muſt have over his ſubjects, whether his authority be greater then all theirs put together in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of laws, or not. Nor is it of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment at all, ſince one without the other can enact no laws, that may have their full and perpetual force, which of them is the greater. The ſtatutes and acts that are made in any Kingdom by the King and Parliament of the place, have the ſame force, whether the Kings Majeſty, who is ſuperiour prince, and head of the Parliament, be above the whole Parliament, that is, of more authority than all the reſt there put together, and weighed in a ballance againſt him yea or no. Nor would he gain or loſe any one jot of his dignity, authority, or reverence, whatever ſhould be concluded in a pair of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſpeculatours ſcales, concerning that point. Although for my part, I hold it little better than buſie ſedition, to rais ſuch fantaſtick doubts. And the danger of it we experienced
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57771:123"/>here in this Kingdom but the other day. And I may be bold to fay, by what I know and heard my ſelf, that the hint was given them by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters talking upon this point of the Popes not being above his Councel. Catholiks know how to obey their Pope and Paſtour, whether he be above or not above a Councel, which ſilly querk concerns not them to think of. But others are apt to catch fire at any thing, which may any wayes diſſolve the bands of their due obedience. Thus much concerning the two points of ſchool-ſpeculation, which your Diſſwader pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies will ſhortly be determined. But he does but dream, and ſo let him ſleep on.</p>
            <p>The third new article, is that which was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced, ſaith he, in the Councel of Trent, ſeſſ. 21. which is, <hi>That although the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did give the Communion to Infants, yet they did not beleev it neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Diſſwader ſeems here tacitly to grant, that all the other Canons and Decrees of the Councel of Trent are old and primitive doctrin. He would not otherwis have culled out from thence this one only article for new.</p>
            <p>I looked into the Councel of Trent, and found there no ſuch article of faith as this your Diſſwader ſpeaks. The Canon or Article of faith concerning this point runs thus. <hi>Si quis dixerit parvulis, antequam ad annos diſcretionis pervenerint, neceſſariam eſſe Euchariſtiae communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57771:123"/>anathema ſit.</hi> And this is all the articles of faith determined in that Councel upon this affair: wherein the faithful are forbid to hold that the Communion of Infants is neceſſary to ſalvation. <hi>If any one,</hi> ſayes the Councel, <hi>ſhall ſay, that communion of the Fuchariſt is neceſſary to babes before they come to years of diſcretion, let him be Anathema.</hi> And this doctrin I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded your Diſſwader himſelf holds for good. But this would not make him ſport enough. And therfor he lets paſs the Canon or Article of faith, and ſpeaks of the doctrin or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which is not propounded for faith at all to any beleever, although all Catholiks that know it, adhere to it as good and ſolid. And this is his firſt legerdemain, to propound that for an Article of faith, which is only a doctrin or declaration of faith. His next trick is, to make it run ſhort like a Canon of faith, wheras it is a large and ſerious explication, wherein thoſe words he catches at are ſo connexed with others, that their rationality there appears, which here is hid. Third is, that he makes it the Councels buſines to determin only a matter of fact of the ancient Fathers not beleeving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants communion neceſſary, though themſelves uſed it: which was none of the Councels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but inſinuated only by way of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation to cut off the arguments of hereticks, who ſtrengthned their errour about the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57771:124"/>of infants communion, by example of the ancient Fathers who practiſed it. <hi>Denique eadem ſancta Synodus docet parvulos uſu rationis carentes nulla obligari neceſsitate ad Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Euchariſtiae Communionem: Siquidem per Baptiſms lavacrum regenerati, &amp; Chriſto incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati, adeptam jam filiorum Dei gratiam in illa aetate amittere non poſſunt. Neque ideo tamen damnanda eſt antiquitas, ſi eum morem in quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam locis aliquando ſervavit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t enim ſanctiſsimi illi Patres ſui facti probabilem cauſam pro illius temporis ratione habuerunt, ita certe eos nulla ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis neceſsitate id feciſſe ſine controverſia creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt.</hi> Thus ſpeaks the Councel in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin or declaration of that Article of faith. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis dixerit.</hi> But enough of this buſines. And although your Diſſwaders talk deſerv it not, yet your own ſatisfaction concerning theſe three novelties here ſpecified, becaus I thought it might haply require what I have ſaid therof, pray take it in good part. And be aſſured that faith and Chriſtianity in the Roman Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes not like the moon; although out of that Church it decreas indeed like the moon in her wain, daily and in all Reformations to the wors.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>Which is about Indulgences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes that the doctrin of Indulgences is wholly new and unknown to antiquity, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius, Prierias, Byſhop Fiſher, Agrippa, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57771:124"/>Durandus, Popiſh doctours do acknowledg. And hence it is, that Gratian and Magiſter ſententiarum, both of them eminent doctors among the Papiſts, have not a word of them. Indeed in primitive times, when the Byſhop impoſed ſeveral pennances, and that they were almoſt quite performed, and a great caus of pitty intervened or danger of death, or an excellent repentance, or that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs interceded, the Byſhop did ſomtimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to the penitent, and relax ſom remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of his pennance. But the Roman doctrin of Indulgence is another thing. They talk of Jubilees and treaſure of the Church, and pilgrimages, which ancient Fathers ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak againſt, or never heard of. In fine, theirs is becom a doctrin of ſolution not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that is, the ſinner is to go free with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any puniſhment: which is deſtructive to true repentance, and right hope, to Chriſts merits, and free pardon, nouriſhes pride and brings in money, condemned by holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and ancient Fathers, who teach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance reducing to a good life, faith in Chriſts merits, and hope in his promiſes. Neither can any Papiſts tell what they are the better for their Indulgences; or whether they be abſolutions or compenſations; whether they take off actual pennances, or potential; ſuch as be due in the court of man, or of God;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57771:125"/>whether they avail, if the receiver do nothing for them, or not; whether they depend only of Chriſts ſatisfaction, or the Saints like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis. And therfor the Councel of Trent durſt determin nothing about all theſe things, but contented themſelves only to declare this, <hi>That ther is in the Church a power of granting Indulgences;</hi> adviſing Catholiks to ſet other ſuperfluous and curious queſtions aſide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, if I had had the opportunity to print the four paragraffs, which to leſſen the book I left out of my <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> becaus one of them was about <hi>Indulgence,</hi> I ſhould need to ſay the leſs to this ſection; wherin I muſt notwithſtanding be brief, that I may ſpeak ſomwhat alſo to thoſe that follow.</p>
            <p>Three things are in this his third ſection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly jumbled together by your Diſſwader concerning this buſines of <hi>Indulgence;</hi> Faith, School-philoſophy, and Abuſes. Catholik faith and Tradition he ſets down himſelf p. 17. and acknowledges it for good. <hi>Now leſt the Roman Emiſſaries,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould deceiv any of the good ſons of the Church, we think it fit to acquaint them that in the primitive Church when the Byſhop im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſevere pennances, and that they were almoſt quite performed, and a great caus of pitty inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened or danger of death, or an excellent repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; or that the Martyrs interceded, the Byſhop did ſomtimes indulge to the Penitent, and relax
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57771:125"/>ſom of the parts of his pennance, and according to the example of S. Paul in the caſe of the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corinthian, gave them eaſe, leſt they ſhould be ſwallowed up with too much ſorrow.</hi> Theſe are his words. And in them he hath ſet down exactly, not only the faith, but all the faith of Roman Catholiks in this point, to ſtop the mouths of Roman Emiſſaries: which faith and practiſe he acknowledges alſo expreſly to be antient and primitive. And thus much he would have us beleev that Proteſtants hold and allow; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not their books and writings only which manifeſtly gainſay it, but their very practiſe, which hath long ago abandoned, and is now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant either of confeſſion or pennance, or relaxation or indulgence; and the very Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Engliſh Proteſtant Church refute him. But he that writes againſt Popery, need not heed what he ſayes. If another ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſo that he ſpeak againſt Popery too, they will both paſs for good.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Papiſts,</hi> ſaith your Diſſwader, <hi>they are quite gone from this primitive way: their doctrin of Indulgence is another thing, quite another thing.</hi> And then jumbles together heaps of their ſchool-diſputes, about ſolutions, abſolutions, compenſations, relaxations, and ſuch like ſtuff; which together with ſom abuſes that time has brought forch, as well in that as other affairs, and which Councels and Paſtours have in all
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57771:126"/>ages endeavoured to rectifie, muſt make up a Miſcellan, which he would have to be thought the Popery of this buſines. Good Lord! Is this ignorance in your diſſwading Doctour, or <hi>illud quod dicere nolo.</hi> He acknowledges mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, that the Councel of Trent decided no more than that very Tradition, which the Church hath kept in all ages, acknowledged here by the Diſſwader himſelf to be primitive. Nor can he bring any Catholik Councel that hath decided any more, or any Goſpel or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for more. If ſchool-divines queſtions, that are raiſed beyond faith in this point as well as hundreds of others, may ſuffice to infer that Roman Catholiks are departed from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent primitive way, although they keep it <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e may as well ſay they are departed from the old faith of the Trinity, Creation, Incarnation, Sacraments, Reſurrection, Juſtice, Grace, and the whole contents of the old and new Teſtament. For though they keep the ancient faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all theſe things, yet have their ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men raiſed many hundreds, nay thouſands of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and concluſions beyond that faith, that be variouſly agitated in the ſchools amongſt them. Your Diſſwaders craft lies in this, that whilſt he brings in here theſe ſchool-diſputes for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith and popery; and points out eminent Doctours amongſt Papiſts, who witnes theſe fancies to be new and unknown to antiquity, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57771:126"/>Antonius, Prierias, Fiſher, Durandus, Mairo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Cajetan; and the Councel of Trent, either not able, or not willing to determin them: he hopes his reader will eaſily beleev, without much labour of his, that Popery is not only a new foppery, but a confuſion inextricable. This is his drift not only in this ſection, but all his whole book. But he is intangled in his own ſnare. For if neither the Councel of Trent determined thoſe things, nor yet any other Councel in the Catholik world, nor any ancient Tradition delivered, nor her Doctours acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them, then is ther not any popery therin: nor is popery any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Wherfor your Diſſawader is very angry with the Councel of Trent, for that they would not there, either juſtifie the abuſes, or determin the ſchool-diſputes in that point; but rather condemned the one, and exploded the other.

They would then give ſom help to temporal authority, and not lay all the burthen upon their ſhoulders, whilſt themſelvs ſit like drones in their fat benefices, and do nothing. But here you may ſee Sir, that all that which your Diſſwader makes here to be Popery; abuſive cuſtoms, and ſchool-philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, is by a general Popiſh Councel expreſly excluded from it. What ſtrange kinde of auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is this, to call that Popery or Catholik faith, which Catholik Doctours deny, Catholik Councels exclude, and Catholik Profeſſours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of. But what your Diſſwader knows to be new, he firſt puts that upon Papiſts for their faith; and then tells them that their faith is new.</p>
            <p>And your Diſſwader, as I told you before, is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57771:128"/>much troubled, and murmurs bitterly againſt the Councel of Trent: for that they would not determin thoſe philoſophical ſubtilties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indulgences be ſolutions or abſolutions, whether donations or compenſations, whether for potential or actual pennances, whether in the Court of God or man, whether out of the treaſure of Chriſt or Saints, whether upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of doing ſomthing or nothing. <hi>The Councel,</hi> quoth he, <hi>ſlubbereth all the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both in the queſtion of Indulgences and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in general and recommendatory terms; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the power of giving Indulgence is in the Church, and that the uſe is wholeſom; and that all hard and ſubtile queſtions concerning Purgatory, (which although if it be at all, it is a fire, yet is it the fuel of Indulgences, and maintain them wholly) and all that is ſuſpected to be falſe, and all that is uncertain, and whatſoever is curious and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſcandalous, or for filthy lucre, be laid aſide. And in the mean time they tell us not what is and what is not ſuperſtitious, nor what is ſcandalous, nor what they mean by the general term of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And they eſtabliſh no doctrin, neither curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nor incurious. Nor durſt they decree the very foundation of this whole matter the Churches trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, neither durſt they meddle with it, but left it as they found it, and continued in the abuſes, and proceed in the practice, and ſet their Doctours as well as they can to defend all the new curious and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57771:128"/>ſcandalous queſtions, and to uphold the gainfull trade.</hi> Thus heavily poor man does your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader complain of the Councels ſilence in thoſe philoſophical points, neither reſolving the doubts, nor ſo much as explicating the terms therof, that he might underſtand, what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and what is ſcandalous, and what they mean by Indulgence, and what by curious, and the like hard words. Ith' interim while the Councel ſends him to ſchool to learn the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe hard words, and the reſult of thoſe diſputes, which belonging not to faith, make little to edification, and from whence no acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to piety can be made, nor indeed any uſeful knowledg, all your Diſſwaders ſport is ſpoiled. And he has ſom reaſon indeed to complain and weep. But I pray you Sir conſider; If I have a releaſement granted me from ſom temporal penalties due to my miſdoings, what does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me to know, whether that releaſement be a ſubſtance or an accident, whether it be in the predicament of quantity or quality, whether it be a ſolution or abſolution, whether it be from power or bounty, whether it iſſue as out of a treaſure, or from a tribunal, or the like. The Schoolmen whence your Doctour picked thoſe curious queſtions, would I am ſure have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with their opinions concerning all ſuch things, if he had ſtaid to read their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. But he was in haſte; and indeed it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57771:129"/>him not to know their reſolution. He had enough, to pick out their philoſophicall prattle in the general heads of it, which becaus it is found in the ſchool-books of ſuch as are Catholik beleevers, he makes no doubt, but the very naming of it will ſuffice to perſwade the Land, that it is all popiſh doctrin and Popery; and that Papiſts cannot agree in it; and that it is new. Indeed Sir, he has great need to go to ſchool to thoſe Doctours, not only to hear their reſolutions, but to underſtand the very terms of the queſtion. For had he known, what thoſe very words of <hi>ſolution</hi> and <hi>abſolution</hi> mean, he had never added that abſurd interpretation of his own, which he give p. 20. <hi>It is a very ſtrange thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a ſolution not an abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is the ſinner is let go free without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, or world to come:</hi> a wiſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a pittiful Divine.</p>
            <p>But I cannot ſtand here to give notice of his ſpecial miſtakes, ſimple inferences, vain inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and particular falſifications, all which are groſs and various. I do only aſſure you Sir, that if he mean by Popery the Religion and faith of Roman Catholiks concerning this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Indulgences, in one period above named, he approves, eſtabliſhes, and ratifies it all. And in all the reſt he ſayes nothing againſt it, and indeed nothing at all to it. For the ſubtile cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious theories that are made by wits upon this
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57771:129"/>ſubject, over and above what their faith extends unto, as well as in all other things even from the worlds firſt creation to its final conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all whatever is contained in the whole Bible, about which they have raiſed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of diſputes, over and above that which is there plainly delivered by their faith, theſe for ſuch as are at leaſure and love them, may ſerve for Academick exerciſe and diſcours. The diſorders and abuſes that have been in this, as well as other affairs, all good men and ſacred Councels have laboured to their power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and rectifie. And are ther not abuſes of all kinds in the Proteſtant world, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any endeavors to the contrary? But the faith that is in this point and all the whole practice of it, Catholiks ſtill hold, and Proteſtants have forſaken it: For theſe have neither confeſſion of ſins, nor pennance for thoſe ſins confeſt, nor indulgence of any ſuch pennances injoyned, as Catholiks have. Indeed the Prelat Proteſtant keeps ſtill one ancient cuſtom of <hi>commuting,</hi> as they call it, which is but a new word for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> when the pennance of ſtanding in a white ſheet for one kind of ſin impoſed, is upon ſom conſiderations releaſed. For although the Reformation have taught, that Matrimony is no Sacrament, but a meer ſecular contract, yet Miniſters I know not how keep ſtill that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court (as they call it) unto themſelves; as
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57771:130"/>being it ſeems the only men that are able to judg in thoſe affairs. But there be other ſins that require pennance and ſatisfaction, beſides that one: and other pennance beſides a white ſheet to be <hi>commuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>Which is about Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes that Purgatory is another ill novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: both becaus the Greek Fathers never make any mention of Purgatory, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the doctrins on which it is built are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fals or at leaſt dubious; as that there is diſtinction betwixt mortal ſins and venial; that ſin may be taken away, the obligation to puniſhment remaining; that God requires of us a full exchange of pennances for the pleaſure of ſin, notwithſtanding Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us. But Papiſts are deceived in this point upon two miſtakes; the firſt wherof is, that ancient Fathers uſed to pray for the dead: but they prayed not in relation to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: and ſo the Church of England al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to pray for the departed, namely as the Fathers did. The ſecond is, that the Fathers ſpeak of a fire of purgation after this life, which was but an opinion of ſuch a thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of judgment. And this is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by thoſe other Fathers, who hold the ſouls to be kept in ſecret receptacles untill dooms-day, which opinion cannot ſtand with Purgatory. Beſide St. Auſtin in his time,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57771:130"/>doubted whether Purgatory was, or no. And though ancient Fathers ſpeak much of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial ſtates and purgations, and fires, and common receptacles and delivery of ſouls, yet they never agreed throughout with the Church of Rome. But Papiſts have been brought into this beleef by frightful relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of apparitions, which the wiſer ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev not. And Tertullian denies that the ſouls of the dead do ever appear. How the Greek Church denies this purgatory doctrin, appears in the Councel of Florence. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over S. Cyprian and others teach againſt it, that after death is no place for pennance, no purgation: and no leſs holy ſcripture, who ſaith, Bleſſed are thoſe who dye in the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What a rapſody of ſtuff is here? <hi>Papiſts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this doctrin of Purgatory out of fals grounds: Papiſts have been frighted into this doctrin of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory by apparitions. The Fathers ſpeak of a fire of purgation after this life, but they meant not as Papiſts do. The Fathers held ſecret receptacles for ſouls until dooms-day; but that cannot ſtand with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Purgatory: though they ſpeak much of interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſtates, yet that does not agree throughout with the Roman doctrin of Purgatory. And bleſſed are the dead; for they <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt from their labours.</hi> Bleſſed ſurely had your Diſſwader been, if he had reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his labours too.</p>
            <pb n="258" facs="tcp:57771:131"/>
            <p> Sir, if your Diſſwader had meant to ſay any thing to the purpos in this affair, he ſhould have clearly ſet down in this his ſection, before he had diſcourſed further, what is the Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef and practice in this buſineſs. But this he utterly omits and neglects to do, leſt he ſhould ſpoil his own ſport; and thinks it enough, in a rambling talk to ſay, that <hi>the Fathers prayed for the dead, the Fathers ſpoke much of intermedial ſtates, but no Greek Fathers, no Latin Fathers agree with the Roman doctrin of Purgatory, S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian denied it, S. Auſtin doubted it, the Scripture is againſt it, the grounds for it are dubious, appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it are frivolous.</hi> And he never ſpeaks one word what that Roman doctrin of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is: nor can I imagin what he fancies it to be. If he do but ſpeak againſt it, be it what it will, he has ſaid enough. So he thinks. But Sir, had he declared it as he ought to have don, it had then clearly appeared, that thoſe Fathers who prayed for a joyful Reſurrection to their friends departed, who ſpeak of a fire of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after this life, of an intermedial ſtate and purgations and delivery of ſouls thence, were directly and perfectly of the now preſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts beleef: and that St. Auſtins doubting, whatever it was, and the Greeks diſagreeing in Florence, and S. Cyprians affirming that ther is no place of repentance after this life, ſo far as they are truly cited, ſtand all very well, perfect,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57771:131"/>and completely with the Roman Catholik be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef and practice.</p>
            <p>But what think you, Sir, of our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church? Does ſhe pray, or ſo much as leave it indifferent to pray for the dead, as this Diſſwader ſpeaks, if it be not don in relation to Purgatory? the name Purgatory I mean. For if they pray for the refreſhment, eaſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſouls departed as ancient holy Fathers did, ther is nothing els but the bare name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, if thoſe prayers bear any ſence. Hath the Proteſtant Church any altar, or prieſthood, or ſacrifice for the dead, which all ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both Greek and Latin ſpeak of, as the uſage and cuſtom of the Chriſtian Church in their times? Does any amongſt them, when he dies, give alms either to prieſts or poor people, or other friends to pray for his ſoul when he is departed hence? Is not he looked upon, that ſhall be heard to ſay for his deceaſed friend, <hi>God give him reſt,</hi> or <hi>God grant him a joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> as either ſom profeſt, or at leaſt a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit and concealed Papiſt? What is it this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour then tells us, of the Engliſh Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing prayer for the dead, which our very Proteſtant articles condemn, and all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have hitherto oppoſed. Nor have they any Prieſts amongſt them to perform any ſuch rite in that way the Fathers ſpeak of, and uſed themſelves on their altars, which are all razed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57771:132"/>here to the ground. And as for the people, they neither do, nor dare, under the danger of being thought Papiſts, if they had the mind, either practiſe or commend any ſuch cuſtom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Greek Fathers never mention Purgatory, as Polydor and Roffenſis witneſs.</hi> Where does Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Roffenſis witneſs that? How would your Diſſwader have them mention it? <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium</hi> is a latin word, and not to be found in greek writings. Did not S. Baſil pray to God, <hi>for reſt and pardon for the ſoul of thy ſervant N. N.</hi> Does not S. Chryſoſtom ſpeak of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſacrifice <hi>for all thoſe who ſlept before us, &amp;c. and for the reſt and pardon of thy ſervant N &amp;c.</hi> Does not S. Cyril frequently ſay, <hi>We offer this ſacrifice for our deceaſed Fathers and Biſhops, and all thoſe who have departed this life, &amp;c.</hi> And S. Epiphanius, <hi>We make mention both of juſt and ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> And what is the Papiſts Purgatory for Gods ſake, but only ſuch a condition of ſouls deceaſed, as requires help from the prayers of the faithful living. This I take to be the Roman doctrin, or Catholik beleef, both of the Eaſtern and Weſtern part of the Church, both Greeks and Latines, wherein all ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians unanimouſly agreed. And your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he may leave it free for every mans thoughts to imagin what he liſts, never ſpeaks himſelf what it ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Fathers prayed for thoſe who perhaps
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57771:132"/>never were in Purgatory, as Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> And they prayed too for thoſe who perhaps were there, or in that condition that required their prayers. Truth is, they prayed far differently for the juſt ones and other men: as any one may ſee in thoſe very Fathers, inſinuated in thoſe your Diſſwaders words. And if ſom juſt ones commemorated by the Fathers wanted not our prayers, does this infer that no condition of ſouls deceaſed wants them, or that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who prayed alſo for others then deceaſed, as wanting thoſe helps, although in another manner than for the juſt, ſhould think ſo? I trow not, however your Doctour throws his ink about confuſedly to blind our eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But S. Auſtin doubted whether there were any Purgatory or no.</hi> And is it likely Sir, that he who in his <hi>Enchiridion. Cura pro mortuis, Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei,</hi> and ſeveral other of his works ſpeaks ſo expreſly of ſouls expiation after death, and of the ſacrifices which himſelf made being a Prieſt for ſouls deceaſed, in particular for his mother Monica, and her husband, for that end ſo expreſly I ſay and clearly, that no Roman Catholik now, either does or could poſſibly ſay more, ſhould doubt whether there were after this life any expiatory place or condition?</p>
            <p>I will but ſet down two or three places of many in that holy Fathers works, which may ſuffice to ſhow his mind. <hi>Temporarias poenas alii

The Diſſwader cannot but have read ſeveral ſuch like paſſages in that eminent Doctor. And the jeſt is, that the place he cites for S. Auſtins doubting of Purgatory, is one of thoſe wherin he expreſly teaches it. So expert a Doctour is this of yours. What is it then St. Auſtin doubted? For he muſt needs doubt ſomthing. Otherwiſe ther had been nothing for your Diſſwader to catch hold of. Speaking therfor of thoſe ſufferings after this life, before eternal bliſs can be obtained, in which condition ſuch as upon a good foundation have built ſom light matter, which the Apoſtle calls wood, hay, and ſtraw, may be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire, S. Auſtin doubts whether thoſe very affections men bear to things in this life, which are lawfully had, but loſt with ſom grief, may not burn, and afflict them in that place of expiation, as well as other venial offences, and be ſom part of the wood,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57771:133"/>hay, and ſtraw the Apoſtle mentions. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the doubt is very rational, and remains ſtill a doubt. But when your Diſſwader takes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon occaſion to ſay, that St. Auſtin doubted Purgatory, I cannot doubt but that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either ſincerity in his heart, or eyes in his head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in the time of Otho, in the twelfth age of the Church, the doctrin of Purgatory was got no further than a</hi> Quidam aſſerunt, <hi>Some ſay ſo.</hi> Sir, Otho here cited to ſay <hi>quidam aſſerunt,</hi> ſpeaks not at all of any expiation after death, as your Diſſwader would have us think, but after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſom divines in thoſe dayes held over and above that which their faith had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: which opinion had then but a <hi>ſome ſay ſo</hi> for it, as it hath alſo now: and it was then, and is now but a philoſophical opinion. Can you beleev your Diſſwader did not ſee this? It was truly, if he did ſee it, a groſs and inexcuſable inſincerity, to make Otho ſay it was only the opinion of ſom, that ther was a purgation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, who expreſly treats of that particular opinion concerning a purgation after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which their faith and religion did not reach unto. But as I told you before, I muſt not inſiſt upon your Diſſwaders falſifications, however they be various and very groſs, becaus that work is well don already, and my deſign looks another way. As he is to blame, for
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57771:134"/>making ſom Fathers think and ſpeak what they did not; ſo is he, while he makes all the Fathers in general to acknowledg and practiſe as much in this point, as any Roman Catholik beleevs, and yet addes withall, that thoſe Fathers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding agreed not with the Roman do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which himſelf never declares what it is, moſt palpably ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the doctrin of Purgatory is grounded,</hi> ſaith your Diſſwader, <hi>upon falſe principles, as upon a ſuppoſed diſtinction betwixt venial ſins and mortal, between ſin and its obligation to puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi> Sir, if we would ſpeak properly, neither is this beleef of future expiations, nor any other point of Catholik Religion to be called a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> or <hi>opinion,</hi> or <hi>judgment,</hi> of ſom divines or all divines, or any ſuch like thing. For it is the faith as well of divines, as other Chriſtians; unto which they as well as theſe ſubmit all equally with the ſame reſignation, and no doctrin of any mans. Upon the pin of this one miſtake, if it be a miſtake, and not rather a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious wilfulneſs, hangs all this your Doctors Diſſwaſive, which being removed, all his whole book falls to the ground. And therfor it were worth the labour to diſcours more copiouſly upon this ſubject; which all Anticatholiks ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand not, or diſſemble, that they may have the more ample field of ſcholaſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and ſom rotten Caſuiſts to ride a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57771:134"/>in, when they chaſe Popery; which the world muſt beleev to be a doctrin of divines. And this doctrin muſt not be the doctrin of any one of their ſchools, much leſs of all their ſchools, but of this or that obſcure man, who followed no ſchool at all: nor any good thing that he delivered, but ſom uncouth odd ſpeech unheedfully dropt from his pen: nor this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly delivered neither, as he ſpoke it, but wreſted and perverted againſt his meaning. And this is the mode of chaſing that wild beaſt of Popery, with ſeven heads and ten horns, made by the ſlight of miniſters both terrible, and yet at the ſelf-ſame time ridiculous to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: not to all: for God be thanked there be very many grave and wiſe men in the land, but only to the inferior and more numerous ſort of people, ſuch as will ſtand to hear Jack Pudding talk in Bartholomew Fair. But I have not now time to enlarge my ſelf upon this ſubject, as it may deſerv. I ſay then that no Catholik faith, which miniſters expreſs by the odious name of Popery, is properly ſpeaking, any mans doctrin; much leſs is it a doctrin grounded upon this or that principle, as indeed all ſchool-doctrin is; but it is a Catholik faith and beleef, grounded immediately upon the veracity and truth of the Revealer our Lord and his Apoſtles. But your Diſſwader ſpeaks ſtill of doctrin, and Roman doctrin, and grounds of doctrin, as if he were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57771:135"/>utterly unacquainted with faith, Chriſtian faith, and of all he is to ſpeak; imagining Religion to be ſom ſchool concluſion of Philoſophers; wherein he is either notoriouſly miſtaken, or would in his heart have others moſt notoriouſly to miſtake. Wherfor, although I could eaſily defend thoſe ſcholaſtical grounds, wheron he ſayes the doctrin of Purgatory is built; yet I muſt firſt tell him that which is of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern both for himſelf and others to know; namely that thoſe are not, be they true or fals, any grounds of Purgatory at all: nor is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory a doctrin built upon thoſe grounds. what then are thoſe aſſertions, that <hi>ſom ſins are mortal, ſom not, that the pardon of ſin may ſtand with an obligation to temporal puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi> They are, Sir, rational congruities invented by Catholik Divines, the more fully to clear unto weak beleevers the rationality and truth of that old Chriſtian Tradition concerning our expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſufferings after this life, before entrance into glory. But if we will look for more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Chriſtian-like grounds for this expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo far as one buſines of faith may be ſaid to be grounded on another, (even as Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are ſaid by ſchool-divines one to flow from the other, namely in order to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which cannot otherwiſe think or ſpeak of that moſt ſimple and infinit being) the great <hi>depoſitum fides</hi> affords other grounds, far
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57771:135"/>better, more intelligible, ſimple and eaſie grounds of Purgatory, than thoſe your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der catches at, although even they be ſolid and good ones too. As for example theſe; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are culled and called out of darknes by the mercy of their gracious Redeemer unto purity, light and holines, which they are to practice and act all their whole life after: and if they do otherwiſe, they ſhall ſuffer accordingly, ſo much of pain as they have had of unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to the deſpight of that precious blood, that redeemed and brought them out of ſin and darknes, and of that holy Spirit of his, wherwith they have been anointed; every one as he hath acted in his body, whether good or evil, being to receiv accordingly after this life. So that he who ſhall at all times, cooperating faithfully with Gods holy grace, keep his hands pure, and heart clean from ſuch enormities, as may violate friendſhip with his Redeemer, ſhall be in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other condition at his departure, then he who hath in his life time polluted himſelf and don injury to the ſanctifying blood of Chriſt by his many filthy adulteries, drunkenneſſes, cheats, ſlanders, murders, or the like, although by Gods grace, he ſhould find mercy at his laſt hour. Theſe, if I could ſtand to enlarge my ſelf upon them, being themſelves Chriſtian Traditions and Apoſtolical doctrin, might in ſom ſence be ſaid to be the grounds of expiatory penalties
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57771:136"/>after this life, commonly called Purgatory. But thoſe others which your Diſſwader mentions, are but ſom congruities latelier put together by Doctours to clear unto unſtable Chriſtians, as far as they may be able, the rationality of their Chriſtian Tradition concerning expiations after this life: which Preachers in their ſermons, and Doctours in their chairs uſually invent and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well in this affair as other buſineſſes of faith, ſom with more firmitude and ſom with leſs, according to their learning and capacity: I ſay they are congruities for it, and good ones too: but no grounds of it. For faith is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by reaſons, or drawn from premiſes, or concluded from grounds. And although this faith be manifold and about ſundry matters, as the Creation, Redemption, Juſtification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the like, yet all theſe particular faiths, depend immediatly like ſeveral raies on one ſun, upon the one only authority and truth of the firſt Revealer, which is the foundation and ground of all. And if thoſe above-named aſſertions be no grounds of this faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future expiations, much leſs is that true and firm tradition, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that dye in our Lord,</hi> any ground againſt it. For they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and happy that ever they were born who dye in our Lord: that is to ſay, in his faith and fear, in his love and grace. But ther are as many degrees of dying in our Lord, as ther be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57771:136"/>of the lives and actions of thoſe that dye in him. And they all reſt from the labours of this life, and ſom alſo are freed from the pains of the other, who depart hence in a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete reconciliation with him.</p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Which is about Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes that Tranſubſtantiation is another novelty in the Roman Church, ſo much a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, that we know the very time of its birth, and how it was introduced. For Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Occam, Biel, Fiſher, Baſſolis, Cajetan, Melchior Caen acknowledg, that it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in Scripture; and in Peter Lombards time they knew not whether it was true or no. Durandus a good Catholik after the Lateran Councel where it was firſt declared, ſaid it was not faith, as Scotus ſayes it was no faith before it: Nor did the Lateran Councel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin that which now the Roman Church holds: which doctrin of theirs is a ſtranger to antiquity, as Alphonſus à Caſtro acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: and the ſame is made good by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Macarius, Ephrem, Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Chryſoſtom, Auſtin, the Canon law it ſelf, Theodoret, and Pope Gelaſius, who all witneſs that the bread is our Lords body ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. And your Diſſwader therfor adviſes his charge, to take heed they be not led away by rhetorical words, to beleev the Roman

                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:57771:138"/>doctrin, which is an innovation and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice: about which they make many fooliſh queſtions: as whether a mouſe may run away with her maker, whether a Prieſt is the Creatour of God, &amp;c. In fine, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is abſolutely impoſſible. For Chriſts glorious body cannot be broken, nor yet the mere accidents, nor one body multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as be many wafers; and it is againſt the demonſtration of our ſences.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I know well enough, that Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr, Euſebius, Macarius, Ephrem, Gregory Nazianzen, Theodoret, Chryſoſtom, and S. Auſtin, were all of them not only Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiks, but Catholik prieſts too, and could eaſily prove it. But if your Diſſwader ſhould have the confidence to deny that: I hope yet he will grant me, that Scotus, Occham, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Baſſolis, Cajetan, Melchior Caen, Durand, and Alphonſus à Caſtro Papiſh School-men and Doctours of the Church, and Friars, were all ſuch: and as for Biſhop Fiſher, Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, and Pope Gelaſius, theſe I may almoſt preſume he will let paſs for Papiſts. What is then this Roman doctrin, which ſo many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctours, whereof each one had ſuch a multitude of diſciples and followers in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik world, do not ſo much as acknowledg? Where ſhall we finde it? For your Diſſwader names heaps of Popiſh Doctours, that deny it,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57771:138"/>and not any one that owns it; nor ever ſo much as tells us what it is. What ſtrange kind of proceeding is this? Nay in the beginning of the ſection, he tells us that this <hi>Popery of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is ſo new, that it is well enough known to have begun in the Councel of Lateran:</hi> and yet in the middle of the very ſame ſection ſayes expreſly, that the <hi>opinion was not determined in the Lateran Councel, as it is now held at Rome.</hi> The Popery or popiſh doctrin of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation now held at Rome, it is very well known to all, ſaith he, that it had its firſt beginning in the Lateran Councel; and yet addes, that the opinion was not determined in the Lateran Councel, as it is now held at Rome. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Sir, was determined in the Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and what is that which is now held at Rome? Does not your Diſſwader ſpeak of the doctrin now held at Rome, when beginning his ſection, he ſpeaks thus? <hi>The doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is ſo far from being Primitive and Apoſtolick, that we know the very time it began to be owned publickly for an opinion, and the very Councel in which it paſſed for a publick doctrin:</hi> which Councel two or three lines afterward he ſayes was the <hi>Councel of Lateran under Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent the third, twelve hundred years after Chriſt.</hi> And againſt that new doctrin which began, he ſayes, twelve hundred years after Chriſt, and thereby convicted of novelty, he writes this
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57771:139"/>his whole ſection. What means he then in the name of God, but only two pages after, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly p. 39. to ſay, that the <hi>opinion was not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Lateran as it is now held at Rome.</hi> Is that opinion now held at Rome, younger or older than the Councel Lateran; and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that opinion held at Rome, or was it from the beginning? And againſt which of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions does he ſpeak in this ſection? For againſt both of them together he cannot. The very head and principal, and as it were the ſumme of all his diſcours in this ſection, <hi>The doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation is ſo far from being Primitive and Apoſtolick, that we know the very time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and the Councel it paſſed for a doctrin, &amp;c. It was but a diſputable queſtion till the Councel of Lateran in the time of Pope Innocent</hi> 1200. <hi>and more after Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> This I ſay cannot agree with the doctrin now held at Rome, which he ſayes afterward is <hi>another thing from that which was determined in the Councel of Lateran.</hi> If then this parcel of Popery, which he ſayes in one place, is not that which was determined in the Councel of Lateran, and in another place is that which was determined in the Councel of Lateran, be the matter and ſubject of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours in this ſection, ought he not in plain terms to have told us, what this piece of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, that we may know what he ſpeaks of. Surely he ought. If it neither be owned by ſo
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57771:139"/>many popiſh doctours which here he names, and names not any one popiſh doctour that owns it: if it neither be determined in the Councel of Lateran, nor he himſelf can name any other Councel wherein it was lately or otherwiſe determined, how is it Popery? What doctours own it? What Councel has declared it? What people profes it? And what is that thing they ſhould profes, declare, or own? What is it I ſay? This he ought to have ſpoken openly, ſincerely, and plainly. And yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not at all, which he ſhould one would think have principally heeded, either to ſet down what doctours own it, or what it is they own: but ſpends his whole time in telling us only of a great company of popiſh doctours that like not of that Roman doctrin, which he never declares himſelf what it is. And then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts all his charge and all good people to take heed of that Roman doctrin, that ſcandalous doctrin, that blaſphemous novelty, which was determined in the Councel of Lateran, and yet is another thing from that which was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Councel of Lateran; not any part of Catholik beleef until that Councel, nor yet eſteemed to belong to faith after that Councel, by the greateſt of popiſh doctours, about which they make many fooliſh queſtions, as whether a mouſe may run away with her maker, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sir, your Doctour, who pretending a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57771:140"/>from Popery, by which he doubts not but his reader will underſtand the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik faith, never meant to touch at all their real Religion, which is univerſally in their hearts and hands, and no power of man is able to confute, but either ſom obſcure parcels of philoſophy, or abuſes of men, which he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to make ſport withall, was fallen here it ſeems upon the Catholik faith, afore he was aware. And therfor he ſuddenly drew back; and ſo blundered up and down in the affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he ſeems neither to know what to ſpeak, nor againſt what he is to ſpeak of. <hi>The Roman doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Lateran Councel: The opinion was not determined in the Lateran Councel, as it is now held in Rome.</hi> What would this man have? What does he ſpeak of? What opinion is that which is now held in Rome, differing from that of the Lateran Councel? What is that doctrin of the Lateran Councel, differing from that is now held in Rome? What is that Rome? the Church of Rome or Court of Rome, the City of Rome or ſchools in Rome? And is it in all Rome or ſom particular ſtreets, or pariſhes, or ſchools, or ſhops? And how do they hold it? with their hands or teeth, or pens or hearts? as a matter of faith, or buſines of diſpute, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them, or invented by them, in their confeſſion of Religion, or profeſſion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy?
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57771:140"/>Theſe things ought all of them to have been expreſt, that we might rightly underſtand who in Rome hold it, and how they hold it, and what is that ſame <hi>It</hi> they hold. But your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader hopes, that upon thoſe general words of his, <hi>The opinion was not determined in the Lateran Councel, as it is now held in Rome,</hi> his unwary reader will be bold to think more, than he dares himſelf utter. And perhaps he is not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For few readers are wiſer than their book.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Romans make many fooliſh and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous queſtions about it.</hi> The more blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and fooliſh they, who urge them to it; if any one amongſt them have reſolved ſuch doubts, as infidelity in deriſion of holy things hath raiſed. They who aforetime denied Gods Incarnation, gave occaſion of as fooliſh and blaſphemous diſputes as any theſe be. And if any then ſtudied to give an anſwer to ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, unmanly, and ſcurrillous oppoſition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might fail in diſcretion, yet their heart was innocent, and intention good.</p>
            <p>The buſines which I ſuppoſe your Doctour would be at here, is the real preſence of our Lords bleſſed and glorious body under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of corruptible elements, which is one of the paragraffs I left out of my <hi>Fiat.</hi> And I am ſorry now with all my heart it was left out: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus here is no time or place to treat of it, as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57771:141"/>that great and weighty ſubject would require. Neither is it my intention here to declare the old Chriſtian Tradition: but only to give you, Sir, to underſtand, that this Diſſwader, though he may hurt his unwary reader, yet he nothing at all indammages the old Catholik faith, by any words of his, which ſpeak it to be new. Large volumes have been written upon this ſubject, enough to ſatisfie any moderate well diſpoſed mind: <hi>qui legit intelligat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me only give you notice Sir, that this parcel of Chriſtian faith now aboliſht here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was ſo antient, that the very old Pagans and Jews derided the primitive Chriſtians above a thouſand years ago, for their worſhipping a breaden God, as they pleaſed then, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of our times are not aſhamed now, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name that ſacred myſtery: It was ſo univerſally beleeved, that their adverſaries by that one only mark expreſſed as it were in ſhort the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Religion; <hi>Since the Chriſtians adore that which they eat,</hi> ſaid one of the Infidel writers, well enough acquainted with the cours of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>let my ſoul be with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:</hi> It was ſo ſure and undoubted in their hearts, that ſom ancient holy Fathers have elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidated the myſtery of the Incarnation, by this of the real preſence in the Euchariſt, as the more manifeſt: It was ſo grave and ſolemn, that all the Churches or Temples in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57771:141"/>world, were built principally for it: and the devotion of thoſe times ſtudied to erect them with a ſtrength and magnificence anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as far as they could, to the majeſty of that divine myſtery: It was ſuch a princely leading point of faith, that it drew all other pieties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, frequent prayers and meditations, alms-deeds, contrition for ſins, ſinging of pſalms, hymns and canticles in the Quire before that preſence in the Altar, Confeſſions, Sermons, Catechiſe, Proceſſions, Faſts, Feſtivals, and all that real fear and love of God, that has been ever found in Chriſtian hearts: Finally, it is the very legacy of Jeſus Chriſt the holy One, to his Spouſe the Church, whereby he proved himſelf both to be a poor and moſt loving and alſo omnipotent Eſpouſe. Another man might leave wealth and poſſeſſions; but though he be never ſo kind and loving, he cannot leave his body to his wife, to remain ever with her for exerciſe of her love, for comfort of her heart, and glorifying of her ſoul, by vertue wherof ſhe ſhould be raiſed up to follow and joyn with him in the eternal glory of another world. This was a Teſtament only fit for Jeſus Prince of Angels and men to make. And this I ſuppoſe is that piece of Popery, your Diſſwader here ſo fumbles at, that he knows not what to call it, or how to expreſs it in his words.</p>
            <p>O, <hi>but it is Tranſubſtantiation which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57771:142"/>diſlikes.</hi> And what is Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what does it mean? What is that long winded hard word of Tranſubſtantiation, what is the meaning of it? For Catholik Religion, which your Diſſwader calls Popery, is not words: nor are words Catholik Religion; but the ſence, and life, and meaning delivered us by help of words for faith, hope, and charity to feed upon. Neither Conſubſtantiality, nor Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor Incarnation, nor Tranſubſtantiation, and ſuch other like phraſes, are any thing at all of any Religion. Your Diſſwader abuſes the world, when he tells you, he knows when Tranſubſtantiation firſt came up. The meaning of it was in the Chriſtian world, all thoſe many ages before that Lateran Councel he ſpeaks of: or elſe it had not been in the world then. Pray let him tell me, whether the <hi>conſubſtantiality</hi> of the Son of God with his eternal Father who made all things, be a novelty or new article, yea or no. <hi>He knows the very time,</hi> as himſelf here ſpeaks, <hi>when it began to be owned publickly for an opinion, and that very Councel in which it was ſaid to be paſſed into a publick doctrin, and by what arts it was promoted, and by what perſons it was introduced.</hi> And if he do not know all this, I can tell him. Does this prove that ſame <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> to be a novelty yea or no? Let him anſwer me directly. I am a plain man, and love plain dealing. Was Jeſus the Son of God
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57771:142"/>and Saviour of mankind beleeved any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be true and really God after that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel had declared him to be conſubſtantial to Almighty God his heavenly Father, than he was before Chriſtians ever heard of that word Conſtſubſtantiality or <hi>Conſubſtantiation?</hi> If Chriſtians notwithſtanding that new word ſtill beleeved and adhered to one and the ſame old faith they did before, then ſay I the ſame of Tranſubſtantiation. And if that new word made no new article, no more does this: Nor doth the one word any more belong to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion than the other: and both indeed only ſo far, as they conveigh the old faith, by this new invented word, guarded againſt the ſubtilties of the hereticks then living, who by their circumventing ſophiſtry deluded all other expreſſions concerning the real preſence of the Godhead in our Lords humanity, and of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in the Euchariſt, ſave only that other of <hi>Conſubſtantatiion,</hi> and this of <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> both words in thoſe dayes equally new. And when thoſe hereſies and hereticks are once vaniſhed, ther is no further uſe of the words amongſt Chriſtians, who beleev and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by vertue of their Chriſtian Tradition, the very thing it ſelf, Gods divinity in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and Chriſts humanity in his ſacred Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, without troubling their heads with thoſe hard words, which were invented againſt
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57771:143"/>ſubtil hereticks, unleſs haply the ſame hereſies ſhould riſe again. And the Catholik flock acts and beleevs after both thoſe Councels, juſt as their Chriſtian predeceſſours did before. They acknowledg Chriſt our Lord really God, and fear, and love, and hope in him, whether they ever hear of his conſubſtantiality or conſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, or no. Nor do they ever trouble their heads to know, what is the meaning of <hi>con.</hi> or what is <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> or what be <hi>accidents,</hi> or what <hi>ſubſtantiation,</hi> or <hi>conſubſtantiation,</hi> no more after that Councel of Nice than before it. Such terms and phraſes are beſides the ſimplicity of their holy and innocent beleef, which holds notwithſtanding all that is really meant by thoſe words, taught them in a more natural and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way. So likewiſe do Catholik beleevers after the Councel of Lateran worſhip their crucified Redeemer in the Euchariſt, in the ſame manner others did before it, being the very ſame Chriſtians with thoſe that lived the age before, and think no more of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation many thouſands of theſe now, then thoſe others did: that word making no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before and after this Councel of Lateran, then had <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> made amongſt the Catholik Chriſtians, which were before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that other Councel of Nice. By thoſe words ſom cunning wolves had been by their Paſtours diſcovered and ſeparated from the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57771:143"/>ſheep; and after that the whole flock fed qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in the ſame hills, and by the ſame fountains they did before. And in this ſence Catholik Divines might ſay, and truly ſay, that Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is not of faith either before the Councel or after, if any one of them did indeed ever ſay ſo. For Chriſtian faith is not words, as I ſaid before, nor words any Religion.</p>
            <p>And if thoſe Catholik Divines, who ever they were, meant any thing elſe; as namely, that the Chriſtians before that Councel of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, who indeed worſhipped their Redeemer in the Euchariſt as true and fully as any that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after that Councel ever did or can, were not given generally to underſtand explicitely, that Chriſt our Lord is ſo preſent in the Euchariſt, that ther is there no other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but himſelf: in this ſence they ſpoke true, that ſo much had not been ſpoken expreſly by a Councel, but yet that the faith and practice of Chriſtians both before and after that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel was the ſame. And ſo conſequently ther was no more of faith after that Councel than was before it; whether we conſider the learned or the common flock of Chriſtians. For theſe worſhip Chriſt in the Euchariſt after that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, as others did before it; though neither of them think of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> and thoſe learned ones ſpake and wrote of our Lords preſence in the Euchariſt before that Councel,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57771:144"/>as others do after it: and both do equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev the thing that is meant by <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which in a diverſe ſence, according as men ſpeak either of the word or meaning of the word, may be either ſaid to be or not to be of faith, either before the Lateran Councel or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.

Cyril in his <hi>Myſtagogica quarta; Hoc ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens &amp; pro certiſsimo habens panem hunc qui vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à nobis non eſſe panem, etiamſi guſtus panem

And indeed the definition of the Catholik Councel makes no alteration at all in the practice of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik faith, which ſo conſiders their Lords preſence in the Euchariſt, that it never heeds the <hi>Quomodo</hi> or concomitances; the adoration, love, and devotion being ſtill and ever in all things the very ſame.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt our Lord ſhould appear to two Chriſtians now, as he did once to S. Paul in a ſplendour of light; and a voice out of that ſhining brightnes ſhould iſſue ſo efficacious, that they ſhould both of them be fully perſwaded in their hearts to worſhip him whom they beleeved both of them there preſent. I ſuppoſe theſe two would equally do well, and equally do the ſame thing, although one of them ſhould haply think ther was no other thing there, but his Lord in an appearance of light, and the other ſhould not think at all of the light, whether it were a ſubſtance or only an appearance of it. But if a third man ſhould deny the real preſence
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57771:145"/>of our Lord in that light, he would for certain be of another faith. So it is here, Proteſtants who deny the real preſence, are of another beleef from Catholiks who acknowledg it; but Catholiks who equally adore it, are all of one beleef, though perhaps not one of a million ever thinks of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation. O but Chriſt might be preſent in the Euchariſt, although Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation were not.</hi> He might ſo: and Chriſt likewiſe may be owned for God, though <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> were never thought of. Both there and here ſomthing is explicately ſpoken, which was latitant in the former practice and beleef, and he that can may underſtand it. But the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that never heard of it, ſo long as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev and worſhip their Crucified Redeemer, as they ought, in the Euchariſt, are never the worſe. Had it not been for hereticks, neither Conſubſtantiation, nor Tranſubſtantiation had been ever heard of: and yet the practice and faith of Catholik Chriſtians the ſame it is.</p>
            <p>The holy Fathers which your Diſſwader cites againſt this particle of Catholik beleef, ſom ſay nothing at all there concerning that thing, ſom ſpeak what he cites in another manner, ſom teach quite contrary. But this I intend not now to inſiſt upon. Only thus much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and I pray you, Sir, mark it well. Thoſe ancient Fathers, who ſay ſomtimes, that the words of our Lord are to be underſtood <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:57771:145"/>not <hi>carnally;</hi> and that thoſe ſymbols are a <hi>figure</hi> of his body, agree with all Catholiks that are now in the world no leſs in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe their words, than others wherin they manifeſtly aſſert the real preſence in this Sacrament. For all Catholiks ſay, that our Lord is not to be ſo underſtood, that his holy body in the Euchariſt is to be fed upon in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, as though it ſhould be divided into gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, and ſo digeſted by the ſtomack into fleſh and blood, as other meats are: but that as that holy body now glorified is becom a ſpiritual body, as good S. Paul ſpeaks, totally ſpiritual and divine, and not now ſubject to any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or laws of material corruptible bodies here on earth, ſo is it ſpiritually to be taken, as the food not of a mortal body, but the immortal ſpirit. So likewiſe do all Catholiks acknowledg and beleev that the ſymbols after the powerfull bleſſing of Chriſts conſecration, do ſo becom his ſacred body, by converſion, mutation, or tranſelementation, as the ſame Fathers ſpeak; that the outward <hi>appearance</hi> which remains of them is not now any more a <hi>figure</hi> of bread and wine as it was before, but of our Lords precious body and blood which have ſucceeded in their place. So that thoſe very words of the ancient Fathers, wherin they ſay, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are now becom a <hi>figure</hi> of Chriſts body and blood, do prove not only a real preſence,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57771:146"/>but a tranſelementation too, or Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which your Diſſwader judges to ſound ſomwhat more. For every material body (I pray you Sir mark this well) I ſay every materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al body here on earth, as a tree, a man, or beaſt, or other thing exhibits to the eye, ear, taſte, or other ſences an outward <hi>ſpecies</hi> of that which it is And the ſubſtance ever goes along in nature with that appearance it exhibits, unleſs the power of God ſhould interpoſe, and make it otherwiſe. Thus when I have bread before me, or milk for example, that I ſee taken from the cow, I ſee it, and feel it, and taſt it, to be ſuch as it ſhows it ſelf; and ſuch it is as it ſhows it ſelf to be. Thus it is in all nature. But we are not, ſay thoſe good holy Fathers, to think ſo here. For though here be the colour and touch and taſt of bread; yet after this ſtrange and powerful converſion made by Gods omnipotent words, it is no more bread you ſee, it is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bread you touch, it is not material bread you taſt, but the bleſſed body of your Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is touched, ſeen, and taſted under thoſe remaining appearances, which are no more now the <hi>figure</hi> of bread, which they were before, but the <hi>figure</hi> of our Lords body under the ſpecies, appearance or repreſentation of bread now wonderfully concealed. And thus much is manifeſtly and clearly expreſt by all thoſe holy Fathers. <hi>Hoc ſciens,</hi> ſaith great
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57771:146"/>St. Cyril of Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp; pro certiſsimo habens panem hunc qui videtur à nobis, non eſſe panem, etiamſi guſtus panem eſſe ſentiat, ſed eſt Corpus Chriſti: &amp; vinum quod à nobis conſpicitur, tametſi &amp; ſenſu guſtus vinum eſſe videatur, non tamen vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſed ſanguinem eſſe Chriſti.</hi> And this ſpeak all holy Fathers, both Greek and Latin. It would be endles to bring their teſtimonies. By theſe few words, if, Sir, you have heeded them well, you will preſently conceiv the meaning of that ſpeech of Tertullian in his third book againſt Marcion. <hi>Acceptum panem &amp; diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum diſcipulis Corpus ſuum illum fecit, Hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum dicendo, id eſt, figura corporis mei. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura autem non fuiſſet, niſi veritatis eſſet Corpus. Caeterum vacua res quod eſt phantaſma figuram capere non poſſet,</hi> &amp;c. And Miniſters are groſly deceived to think the Fathers ſpeak of a <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>trope</hi> in Rhetorick, it is manifeſtly apparent they ſpeak of a figure in nature; that figure or ſhape, which accompanies natural things, which in this myſterious Sacrament is made by the power of God to accompany another ſubſtance. So that here the appearance of natural bread is no more the <hi>figure</hi> of bread, as naturally it is, but the figure now of our Lords bleſſed body, couched by the power of God under that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is naturally the figure of wine and bread. And a figure of the body it could not be, unleſs the ſubſtance of that body were
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57771:147"/>really and truly there under that figure or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; <hi>Figura non fuiſſet, niſi veritatis eſſet corpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in Peter Lumbards time, Tranſubſtantiation was ſo far from being an article of Catholik faith, that they did not know whether it were true or no, as appears by the ſame authour in his</hi> 4. <hi>book and eleventh diſtinction: ſo that it made haſte to paſs in the Lateran Councel for faith, which about fifty years before, in Lumbards time, was but a new diſputable opinion.</hi> Your Diſſwader had done wiſely, if he had produced for himſelf, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he does, only ſome obſcure authours, which ſeldom fall into mens hands. But Peter Lumbard the maſter of ſentences, is an authour ſo known by all, and in every mans hand, that your Diſſwader, had he not utterly abandoned both honeſty and reaſon too, had never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him. For this great maſter from his eight to the fourteen diſtinction of his fourth book, doth with all ſolidity and art, ſo declare and confirm the real preſence in this Sacrament of the Altar, and the converſion of the elements by Gods powerful word into the very ſubſtance of our Lords body, as a great article of ancient Chriſtian faith, that nothing can be ſaid either more ſolidly, or with more earneſt reſolution. But, <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere, dementat.</hi> After your Diſſwader had wilfully thrown away his honeſty, God in his juſt judgment ſo darkened
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57771:147"/>his reaſon, that he could not ſo much as heed what he ſaid. There I ſay that learned Catholik Doctour does induſtriouſly and in a copious manner in thirty whole pages together accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the edition I have by me, printed at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, both declare and eſtabliſh that Catholik Chriſtianity of the real preſence, and tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the elements into Chriſts ſacred body, anſwering and clearing many things which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and pagan philoſophers might object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And your Diſſwader takes hold of one of the philoſophical objections, which the great maſter preſently ſolves, for an argument of the maſters own doubting; although he could not but ſee him aſſert, declare and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the contrary, the real preſence I mean, and miraculous mutation of the elements into the ſubſtance of our Lords fleſh and blood, in all that his copious and learned diſcours, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after that objection. O unhappy Kingdom of ours, by theſe lying fals teachers ſo wofully miſled. This one only paſſage, which any one that hath but a mediocrity of learning may ſee with his own eyes, may ſuffice to ſhow what a man your Diſſwader is, and how little to be credited. But whom God will overthrow for his grand miſdemeanours, him he in his juſtice blindeth. I could find in my heart to give here an abridgment of all that great maſters diſcours concerning this Sacrament of the altar, as he
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57771:148"/>there calls it. But it is ſomwhat beſides my way, and I have already been too long. <hi>Qui legit intelligat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great weight and importance of this buſineſs hath made me ſpeak ſomthing more of it, than I ſhall of other things. That I may therfor here recapitulate in brief, what I have hitherto ſaid to manifeſt your Diſſwaders inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy, and to ſpeak plainly, his impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this point:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt he is faulty, in that he never declares this buſines of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, what it is, or what it means in the beleef and judgment of that Roman Church he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:</item>
                  <item>Secondly, that he makes all the Popiſh Doctours which he mentions concerning it, to ſpeak againſt it, and to diſown it, whatever he meant by it, and not any one of them to ſpeak for it, or profes it. And how then is it Popiſh or Popery.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, that he ſayes in the beginning of his ſection, that <hi>the piece of Popery he here writes againſt was firſt determined in the Councel of Lateran,</hi> and yet but two pages after, forgetting himſelf, he ſayes, <hi>that the opinion was not determined in the Lateran, as it is now held in Rome:</hi> and yet never expreſſes how it is now held in Rome, or what that is which is now held in Rome contrary to the Councel, or by whom, or in what manner.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, becaus the buſines of the <hi>real Preſence,</hi> which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants love to call Tranſubſtantiation, that they
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57771:148"/>may play with that fine long gingling word, as children with a rattle, is not touched at all by him.</item>
               </list> And yet that is all the ſubſtance of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this point: which, that Berengarius the heretick, together with his aſſociates might fully acknowledg without any ſlight of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold evaſions uſed by him, this word was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Prelates of the Councel, as was Conſubſtantiation by thoſe of Nice, for a firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſtabliſhment of Catholick Tradition, and ancient truth. So that your Diſſwader here touches but the lid and rind, not the heart and ſubſtance of Popery, which he is afraid indeed to deal with. And being weak in ſence, he playes with words.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <hi>Which is againſt Popiſh Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that the half-communion is another Innovation in Popery, ſwerving from the Apoſtles practice, and Chirſts Inſtitution: as appears in the Popiſh Councel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where it is decreed, though Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and primitive Chriſtians received in both kinds, yet that no Prieſt under pain of Excommunication ſhould communicate the people under both kinds, which is a bold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to Chriſt himſelf: although even their own Caſſander and Aquinas teach, that to be the ancient cuſtom of the Church, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius reſolves it dogmatically, that the one is not to be communicated without the other.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="292" facs="tcp:57771:149"/>
            <p> This buſines, Sir, is more amply diſcuſſed and cleared in my <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which you have by you. If you do but read that, I ſhall have here leſs to ſay. But know Sir, that this buſines touches not any unalterable dogme of faith, but an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable uſe and practice, as ſhall be declared by and by: and therfor is it not to be called Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, upon that account. And a change in ſuch things is ſo far from blame, that it is oftentimes neceſſary; ſo long as the ſubſtance of Religion is preſerved intire, as here it is. Chriſtians are to faſt after the departure of the Eſpouſe: and ſet times therfor to be appointed, that ſuch a good work be not in the Church of God utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected: yet the dayes and times are ſome of them for urgent reaſons altered. They did faſt on Wedneſdayes and not Saturdayes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places; now on Saturdayes not Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes. Chriſtians did ſtand at their Liturgy all Paſchall time; now they kneel. Little children were in old time communicated after Baptiſme in many places of the Catholik world; now no where. Abſolution is now given upon an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion and a promis either expreſt or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite of performing the due pennance; but it could not be in ancient times obtained, till the pennance was fulfilled. Prieſts may be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated now at twenty five years old, in former times not till thirty. Many holy dayes were then kept, which now cannot: Many now,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57771:149"/>which could not then. Communion was oftner in ſom ages, than it is now. There is a reaſon for all theſe changes of diſciplin and cuſtom. But the ſubſtance of Religion remains ever the ſame, about Faſts, Liturgy, Baptiſm, Pennance, Confeſſion, Prieſthood, Feaſts, Communion, and ſuch like things, though ſom circumſtance may change. So concerning this point of the Euchariſt the ſubſtance of Religion is, that in memory of our bleſſed Lords Paſſion, a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or conſecration of bread and wine be made in the Church of God by his Prieſts for ever, until our Lords ſecond coming: to the end that the Church his ſpouſe may ever have his body with her to feed upon. This I ſay is the ſubſtance of religion in this point. But ſom cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as may, will change. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Prieſts rarely celebrated in ſom times of the Church, but yet when any Maſs or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach was kept by any one of them, all the other Prieſts and Clergy-men that were near would aſſuredly be preſent at it, and hear and pray, and meditate with other people in moſt humble and fervent manner, as became all good Chriſtians to do: but now in this laſt age they go gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally every one to the Altar daily. Which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is the better, I will not here determin. But I am ſure, that great S. Francis commanded all his children to hear Maſs once a day both Prieſts and others; but forbad thoſe that were
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57771:150"/>Prieſts every day to celebrate; and I think he had the Spirit of God in him. In old times all Chriſtian Prieſts had their head covered at the Altar with an <hi>Amictus</hi> or amice of pure linnen, now they generally let it fall into their neck, and their heads are utterly bare. And time will come, that they will put it upon their heads again. So likewiſe for good and juſt reaſons, were catholik people in ſom times and places communicated in the one kind, and ſom time in the other, and ſom time and place in both. But they were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard Communion; nor was ever the Sacrifice of the Altar ſtopped. Nor is it ſo indifferent a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to conſecrate or celebrate in one kind, as it is in one kind to communicate. For Communion reſpects the thing contained, the body and blood of Chriſt, which was ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be equally preſent in either kind. But the ſacrifice or conſecration in one kind would not figure our Lords death and paſſion, and the effuſion of his blood, as it ought to do. But this great Chriſtian work of ſacrificing, which is eſſential Religion, and the very characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal badg of Chriſtianity, becaus our Proteſtant Reformers caſt it off, they talk ever ſince, only of Communion of lay-people, as though the ſacred benediction, or conſecration and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which indeed is the Chriſtian ſacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rite and figure of Melchiſedek, recounted, admired, and worſhipped by all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57771:150"/>Chriſtians, were inſtituted only for that end. Wheras indeed Chriſt our Lords inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touches immediately the figuration only of his death and paſſion, which is completly don in the ſacrifice conſummated by the Prieſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the peoples communion, unto whoſe comfort and benefit all that work of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is exerciſed in the Church, ought to follow by ſequel, when it is neceſſary or expedient.</p>
            <p>Now the ancient primitive Church ſo firmly beleeved, that the bleſſed body and blood, and whole humanity and divinity of Chriſt, were ſo preſent to thoſe ſacred ſymbols after the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or conſecration of them by their Prieſts in Chriſts name and vertue, tho it be unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and wholly ineffable unto us: that if a man with an indifferent and unprejudiced eye will but look back upon antiquity, he may plainly ſee, that in all ages it was indifferent to Chriſtians, though not to conſecrate, yet to communicate either in one kind or both. For the younger people, and ſuch as were ſick, were generally communicated only in the liquid kind; and others, though ſom alſo received in both when ſolemn Communion was made, yet that in the very primitive times, they thought it all one to receiv either in both or one, S. Cyprian, S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, and Tertullian, very ancient Prieſts and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do abundantly witneſs. For Tertullian in his book <hi>de oratione,</hi> deſcribing the Chriſtian
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57771:151"/>wayes of old, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque adeo accepto corpore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſtationem liceret ſolvere:</hi> that is, when they had communicated the body of their Lord, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the chalice, they brake up their ſtation, and had their <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> to be gon; as it is now even at this day among Catholiks. And as for S. Baſil, he in his epiſtle to Caeſarea Patricia, tells at large how Chriſtians in thoſe dayes communicated four times a week and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if a Martyrs feaſt chanced to fall in the week: and how, that if perſecution happened ſo violent, that a Prieſt could not be had to give the people Communion, they were forced with their own hands to touch that ſacred body, which was conſecrated and kept in <hi>ciborium</hi>'s, boxes or pixis for them. And this the peoples irreverence of touching the ſacred body, good S. Baſil labours to excuſe, both by the urgency of their devotion and need; and alſo by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Hermits, who leading a monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life, for want of Prieſts at that time among them, kept the ſacred Communion in their cells, and received it with their own hands, touching it, contrary to the general cuſtom, when devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and piety required: as alſo by that of the Chriſtians in Alexandria, and Egypt, who in ſuch times of perſecution and danger, would have the ſacred Communion at home in their own houſes, leſt upon any neceſſity they ſhould chance to dye without it: and laſtly by the very
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57771:151"/>cuſtom of Prieſts in the Church, who then ſo delivered the hoſt to communicants, that when it was put by the Prieſts into their mouths, they touched ſom part of it, who received it, with their own hands. All this S. Baſil there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes more at large: which agree well to the conſecrated bread, thus touched by the people in time of neceſſity, thus put into their mouths by the help of the Prieſts and their own hands, thus kept at home in times of perſecution, thus reſerved in pixes or little arks, but not at all to the chalice And all thoſe devout Chriſtians, thought themſelves ſufficiently communicated in one kind, who underſtood Chriſtianity as well ſurely, as we do now abov a thouſand years after them. St. Cyprian likewiſe in his book <hi>de lapſis,</hi> has much to the ſame purpos, giving us alſo to underſtand by his teſtimony, that thoſe ancient Chriſtians for fear of death, and the grievances of perſecution, had uſually the Sacrament kept by them in a Repoſitory or Ark in their houſes, which with all devout reverence when they were neceſſitated to it, they put with their own hands into their mouths, and participated on ſuch like occaſion, although by general cuſtom it uſed to be put into their mouths by the hands of Prieſts. And he relates amongſt other things a frightful ſtory of a certain woman, who for fear or other weaknes had complied to the idol ſacrifices: and when ſhe came home, to repent
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57771:152"/>and humble her ſelf in her Oratory, and by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communion both to expiate that her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſtrengthen her againſt the like temptation, as ſoon as ſhe had opened her <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borium</hi> or <hi>Pixis,</hi> wherein the body of her Lord and Redeemer was kept, a terrible flaſh of fire iſſuing thence upon her, did ſo affright her, that ſhe durſt not touch it. <hi>Quandam,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>mulierem ſacrificiis idolorum contaminatam, cum Repoſitorium ſeu Arcam ſuam, in quâ ſanctum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini poſuerat, manibus pollutis tentaſſet aperire, ignis efflans eam terruit, nec tangere erat auſa.</hi> This and much more might be brought to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that primitive Chriſtians thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves completly communicated in one kind, and this very kind that is now in uſe amongſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks. But I muſt come to your Doctour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Half-Communion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is another Popiſh novelty, wherby they deprive the people of Chriſts blood,</hi> Sir, if they eat in memory that Chriſt died for them, which they do, and which in all Proteſtancy makes a perfect communion, how are they deprived of his blood Can they beleev his death and paſſion without faith of his blood ſhed for them? <hi>But they ought to have wine as well as bread.</hi> So they have: as much as the Diſſwader and his Church allows their people, wherby they may <hi>feed upon Chriſt,</hi> who ſhed his blood for us, <hi>in their heart by faith with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;</hi> and which as your Diſſwader here
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57771:152"/>ſpeaks, may make Chriſts body and blood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them <hi>by ſacramental conſequence.</hi> And how is it then a half-communion? <hi>O but the wine is not the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Not carnally as your Diſſwader ſpeaks of his Sacrament, but it is ſo by ſacramental conſeqence. It is as much then as yours the blood of Chriſt. And how is it then a half-communion, and yours a whole one? <hi>O but their bread is beleeved to be the body of Chriſt.</hi> So it is: but yours is not. And therfor if theirs be but a half-communion, yours is none at all. But how good Doctour <hi>Diſſwaſive</hi> is half-communion either new Popery, or old Popery, or any Popery at all? Roman Catholiks or Papiſts uſe no ſuch word: nor do they own any ſuch thing as <hi>Half-Communion.</hi> They beleev and call it a whole Communion. Is it lawful for you to forge a Popery of your own, and then put it upon them, who neither in thought, word, or any of their writings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any ſuch thing. <hi>But is not Communion in one kind all one with Half-Communion?</hi> No, Sir, it is not all one. It differs as much as half and whole. And that I think is ſomthing. It is a whole Communion Sir, both in the tenour of their beleef, and according to that of yours. And why then ſhould you call it a <hi>half-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi> According to theirs, whole Chriſt is equally preſent under either of thoſe figures or appearances: and therfor according to their
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57771:153"/>faith it is a whole Communion. And according to yours it is no leſs. When you your ſelves give the bread to your people, and ſay, <hi>Take this in remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, and feed upon him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving,</hi> you do not intend I ſuppoſe, nor do the people mean to feed only upon one half of him. Why then would your Diſſwader injuriouſly miſname that a half-communion, which in all opinions is a whole one. Neither Catholiks nor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants feed upon the ſigns but thing ſignified. This difference too there is, that Catholiks have all the myſtery of the paſſion repreſented to them in their ſacrifice, and the preſence of the whole Lord in their Communion. But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have no ſuch thing: although the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery be preacht to them. And therfor is the Catholik not a half but whole Communion; and that of the Proteſtants may well be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it be any Communion at all, though it be a whole Sermon. For how can any one diſcern the Lords body there, where in reality it is not? If your Diſſwader had a candour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a gentleman, he would neither falſifie the wayes, nor miſname the practice of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But be it as it is. Since Papiſts, as he will have them called, have equally uſed the Communion in the liquid kind alone, as this in only the other, why ſhould he call one of them more than the other by the name of Popery.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57771:153"/>And why is not Communion in both kinds, which he acknowledges to have been more in uſe amongſt them, and proves it by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their own popiſh doctours, be rather Popery than either of the other. <hi>O but this half-communion began but in the Councel of Conſtance.</hi> I have ſufficiently ſhown you, Sir, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was in the world, before the City of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance knew what Chriſtianity were.</p>
            <p>And even this Councel of Conſtance is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Diſſwader too: as if he had ſworn to act nothing ſincerely. That buſines in the Councel was thus. Petrus Dreſdenſis, and other aſſociates of Huz, had taught publickly, and with much ſcandal, that the Euchariſt is neceſſarily to be given to lay-people after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in both kinds. This doctrin and practice of theirs was cenſured by the Councel, which at one and the ſame time declared thoſe two circumſtances of communicating in both kinds and after ſupper, not to be of neceſſary obligation, becauſe the Canons and approved ancient cuſtom of the Church, had never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thoſe two circumſtances, as of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be obſerved. But what does your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here? Firſt he ſets down the Councels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in direct oppoſition to Chriſt. <hi>Whereas Chriſt inſtituted, &amp;c. yet we command contrary, &amp;c.</hi> as though the Councel had abſolutely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled Chriſts inſtitution: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57771:154"/>they acknowledg and allow for good: and only declare the two ſaid circumſtances in that inſtitution of our Lord, not to be of that neceſſity as the ſubſtance of the inſtitution it ſelf, giving for their reaſon for it, which your Diſſwader thinks not good to take notice of, that the Canons and ancient cuſtom of the Church had ſufficiently made manifeſt, that thoſe two circumſtances of communicating at night and in both kinds were not neceſſary, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary practice in primitive times. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whereas the Councel joyned both the circumſtances together, namely of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in both kinds and after ſupper, he quite leaves out that of receiving after ſupper: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it would as much have inferred the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice to be againſt Chriſts inſtitution as the Popiſh is: and ſo his talk would either have been of no value, or againſt himſelf. Thirdly, whereas the Councel declared only againſt the opinion which thoſe Hereticks had of the neceſſity of thoſe two circumſtances, and correſponding practice, he makes them to condemn not their neceſſity, but the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances themſelves, which the Councel never thought of. Fourthly, he delivers that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels declaration againſt thoſe circumſtances, as if it had been a dogme of faith, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Popery or Catholik Religion, wheras it was delivered in order to the circumſtances
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57771:154"/>themſelves but as a temporal law and decree, though in order to the neceſſity of thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it be a conſtant Catholik truth. And therfor the Councel of Baſil, which a little after determined the ſame doctrin, namely that Prieſts are not bound to communicate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both kinds, whereof they alſo give their reaſon, <hi>quia certa fide tenendum eſt, quod ſub ſpecie panis non tantum caro, &amp; ſub ſpecie vini non ſanguis tantùm, ſed ſub qualibet ſpecie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus totus continetur, ſeſſ.</hi> 30; yet they allowed the Bohemians and Moravians, who deſiring to ſubmit to the Catholik Church, and yet in their weaknes could not comply with that cuſtom, to be communicated in both kinds. Theſe four are ſhifts of much inſincerity, but I muſt bear with him. His other authorities againſt this Catholik cuſtom now generally in uſe, may be eaſily underſtood by what I have hitherto ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what they mean. But that of Paſchaſius I cannot but give you notice of it. For Paſchaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſpeaking of one certain ceremony in the Prieſts celebration of Maſs, wherin he drops a piece of the hoſt into the conſecrated chalice. <hi>Very rightly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the fleſh ſociated with the blood, becaus neither the fleſh without the blood, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Therfor,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are well put together in the chalice, becaus from one cup of Chriſts Paſsion, &amp;c.</hi> From thoſe words, which ſpeak only the Prieſt's action in
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57771:155"/>the ſacrifice of Maſs, your Proteſtant Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would prove his communion of people in both kinds, of which Paſchaſius neither ſpoke nor thought. Is he not hard put to it think you? or is he ignorant rather of what he ſpeaks. But he is gon to his next ſection, and I muſt follow him.</p>
            <p>§. 7. <hi>Which is againſt Service in an unknown Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that the Roman Church offends no leſs in another of their Novelties, of uſing an unknown tongue in their Service; which uſe can no more be reconciled with Saint Pauls fourteenth chapter to the Corinthians, than adultery with the ſeventh Commandment: and Origen, Ambroſe, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Auſtin, Aquinas alſo and Lyra ſpeak all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: no leſs alſo the Civil and Canon Law. Indeed what profit can he receiv, who hears a ſound and underſtands it not: a dumb Prieſt would ſerve as well: for God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his thoughts. The popiſh people that pray in their churches they know not what, can have no affection, becaus they have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their own prayers. Therfore let every tongue prais the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Diſſwader, that he may the better expreſs the confuſion and darknes that is in this popiſh cuſtom, which he means here to ſpeak againſt, uſes a confuſed and dark ſpeech
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57771:155"/>of his own, and confutes it rather by emblem than reaſon. His reader no doubt will imagin, or els the Diſſwader fails of his end, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiks <hi>do not underſtand their own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church;</hi> that <hi>God is not praiſed by them in every tongue;</hi> that <hi>they are not at all edified by their Liturgy or Maſs;</hi> that <hi>they joyn not their deſires, nor underſtand what they ſay or ask of God;</hi> that <hi>their heart ſayes nothing nor asks for nothing, and therfor receivs nothing;</hi> that <hi>they underſtand not in particular, what they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or beg of God;</hi> that <hi>their own ſouls have not any benefit by their prayers;</hi> and that <hi>the Church will not ſuffer them to be brought out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable ignorance.</hi> All theſe things are jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly ſaid and aſſerted in this his ſection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Roman liturgy, &amp; muſt as he hopes be beleeved by his reader. But ther is not a Roman catholik in the world, however ignorant and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he be, but will be ready to tell your Diſſwader to his face, that ther is not of all this, any one word of it true. But he imagines that Roman Catholiks come to Church like Proteſtants, there ſtanding or ſitting, and looking upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till a black-coat comes to read ſom prayers in their ears. But in this he is groſly miſtaken, as all Catholiks know, though others do not. They have their obſecrations, their meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their poſtulations, their pſalms, their eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, which humbly upon their knees they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57771:156"/>pour forth to their Redeemer, both while their prieſt is with them at the altar; and before, and after too. Nor is there a bleſſeder ſight to be ſeen on earth, than devout Catholicks in a Church; wheras others ſtand or ſit, gazing about, till the <hi>Parſon</hi> comes to make uſe of their ears, neither heart, nor lip, nor hand, nor knee, nor breaſt being to them of any uſe. And this every one would underſtand as well as I, if he underſtood Catholik cuſtoms and religion as I do. Nor does the Prieſt come to the altar to teach the people what they ſhould ſay, but to pray and make an atonement for them. And in his confeſſion, entrance, hymn of <hi>glory to God on high,</hi> prayer, epiſtle and goſpel, and his whole work of conſecration and offering, they go along with him in their meditations, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and requeſts, underſtanding all the whole matter and buſines of that heavenly devotion, though they hear not his particular words, which it would be all one to them, whether they were in latin or in the mother tongue. I know alas, I ſpeak but in vain, to ſuch as are brought up in another way, and by fallacious ſlights of miniſters are lead into a miſconceit of the ancient religion of this Land; which till they ſee it again, they can hardly ever rightly underſtand. Prejudice is a lettance almoſt unremovable. And it concerns miniſters, that ſuch a prejudice ſhould be continually rivetted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57771:156"/>into peoples minds, who muſt either be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or miniſters undone. But he that ſees Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik people at their devotions, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at theirs, would, if he be any wayes diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, conclude with himſelf, that Catholik people ſerv God in earneſt, Proteſtants but in jeaſt.</p>
            <p>Truth is, the Catholik Liturgy is only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Chriſts death and paſſion, which our Lord appointed ſhould be exhibited to the eyes of his beleevers, ſo long as the world ſhall laſt: that coming ſtill together, they may worſhip there their crucified Lord, and pour forth in him all their requeſts, every one according to their ſeveral neceſſities. So that the prieſt and peoples great work is ſoon ended; the conſecration, lifting up the hoſt and chalice, and adoration, being all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in half a quarter of an hour: and in ſom Churches, that eſpecially of Ethiopia, in yet leſſer time. And all the prayers and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what other things the Prieſt either ſpeaks with his lips or heart beſides, are only to diſpoſe himſelf, before and after that great work. And in all times have Chriſtian people ever made it their ſpecial care, to furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs with ſuch meditations and affections, as that their ſolemn work of adoration requires. I find in my heart here to ſet down the way I have been taught to hear Maſs, and which I
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57771:157"/>practiſe my ſelf. Such an ocular pattern would I am ſure give more ſatisfaction to my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than any general words I can ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. But I ſhall have ſom better place for that hereafter.</p>
            <p>The teſtimony of authorities which your Diſſwader brings againſt this Roman cuſtom of one and the ſame language all over the world, which he calls an unknown tongue, either ſpeak nothing at all to that buſines, or ſay nothing but what Papiſts ſay themſelves; and many of them by his uſual trick either of total falſity, or partial depravation, are made by your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpeak againſt a cuſtom, which they never ſo much as dreamed to impugn. If Origen ſay, that the <hi>Grecians in their prayers uſe Greek, and the Romans the Roman language, &amp;c.</hi> ſo ſay all Papiſts too. The Maronites with ſome others uſe the Hebrew Liturgy, Grecians the Greek, and Weſtern Chriſtians the Roman; and ſo every one in his own tongue, that is proper to that part of the Church wherof he is a member, prayeth and praiſeth God. And yet it was never thought neceſſary that any people in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world ſhould have their Liturgy in their mother tongue. Again, if St. Ambroſe ſay, <hi>when people meet for edification in the Church, things ought to be ſpoken which hearers underſtand:</hi> ſo ſay, and ſo do Papiſts alſo. For all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are made for edification, are ever
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57771:157"/>in the mother tongue, or vulgar language of the Countrey; and in ſo plain a manner they either are or ſhould be uttered, that hearers may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and edifie thereby. But the Chriſtian ſacrifice is offered up to God, not for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples edification or inſtruction, but for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and peace. Likewiſe if S. Jerom and Ulphilas <hi>tranſlated the Bible:</hi> ſo has it been tranſlated by ſeveral other Prieſts ſince their time, I beleev into all languages of the world, and is continually read and expounded in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Countreys, now one myſtery of it, then another, unto peoples conſtant edification. But this infers not that it ever was or ought to be read in the Churches, one chapter after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, inſtead of their Liturgy. No ſuch thing did antiquity ever hear of. If the civil law of Juſtinian ordain <hi>all byſhops and Prieſts to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the ſacred oblation not in a low voice, but with a loud clear voice, which may be heard by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> ſo do Roman Prieſts at this day act all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Canon. But how came the firſt reforming Proteſtants to leave off the name of Prieſts, but only becaus they had no ſuch ſacred oblation, which was aboliſhed by them, any longer now to make. Again, if there iſſued from Pope Innocent the third, a precept or decree in the Councel of Lateran, <hi>that in the ſame city,</hi> as your Diſſwader here ſpeaks, thinking it I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev to be ſom City called Lateran, <hi>where people
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57771:158"/>had then met together from ſeveral parts of the world, ſervice ſhould be celebrated according to the diverſity of ceremonies and languages;</hi> no doubt but that precept or decree was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved throughout all the City of Rome, where that Councel was kept. And the Maronites with their adherents, had the ſacred Liturgy in Chaldee or Hebrew, the Grecians in Greek, others in Latin, with ſuch variety of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies therin, as was uſed in theſe ſeveral nations, though they acted the ſame thing in ſubſtance. So that ſuch as came from Syria, Egypt, or Greece, were not bound to be preſent at the Latin Liturgy, although they were then in Rome; nor yet the Romans to the Hebrew or Greek Maſs. And if any were met there from our Engliſh Sarum Church, they might uſe their Sarum Miſſal, and not that of the Roman Dioces, although it might have ſhorter, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps longer graduals, more or fewer meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or differing evangiles, or a longer ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of conſecration. This difference is ſtill in the world amongſt Roman Catholiks at this day, and ever was and will be, althoug the whole ſubſtance of their Meſſach or Liturgy be every where the ſame. And for this reaſon a Dominican Fryar, now deceaſed, coming over ſome years ago into England, becaus he began his Maſs with <hi>Confitemini Domino,</hi> after the manner of the Dominicans, and not with the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57771:158"/>uſual pſalm, <hi>Judica me Deus,</hi> although they had patience with him till he had ended, yet the women that were preſent at it, got together afterwards, and in their indiſcreet zeal fell upon him, and beat him for a counterfeit. And if the Councel be of any force here, (otherwiſe why is it brought) then are Catholiks according to that Councel to celebrate in the very ſame city here with Proteſtants without controul, though they uſe diverſity of ceremonies and languages. All theſe authorities then, make nothing againſt this piece of Popery, but rather confirm it. And the gloſſes which your Diſſwader makes upon them, and all his inſulting invectives, are but the froth of his own evil will.</p>
            <p>When your Diſſwader tells us further, that Baſil, Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Auſtin, Aquinas and Lyra ſpeak againſt Service in an unknown tongue, as unapt to edifie; the aforenamed Catholik Gentlemen, who have endeavoured with all care to ſearch the Libraries for a trial of your Diſſwaders honeſty, have found in ſom of thoſe Fathers no ſuch book as your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cites, and in none of them any ſuch words. Which I am apt to beleev, not only by reaſon of the induſtrious ſincerity of the ſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and palpable inſincerity of this Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but for other ſpecial reaſons drawn from the authors themſelves. For St. Baſil and St. Chryſoſtome, St. Auſtin and St. Ambroſe, the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57771:159"/>two firſt were Greek Prieſts that uſed a Greek Liturgy of their own, one of them an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop or Patriarch, the other a monk; the two laſt, S. Ambroſe a Prieſt and Biſhop of Millain in Italy, S. Auſtin the like in Africa, and founder of the Auguſtin Canons regulars, and Hermits, uſed a Latin one: both which differed even in their times from the vulgar language of their reſpective places. And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas and Lyra are manifeſtly known to be later popiſh Prieſts and Friars, uſing one and the ſame Latin Liturgy, differing from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of England and Spain. As alſo becaus it is unlikely, they would uſe this Diſſwaders reaſon, <hi>becaus ſuch unknown tongues in the litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy would not edifie.</hi> For though edification in a large ſence may well agree with the Maſs or Liturgy; in that, it excites holy and heavenly affections; yet in its proper ſence it is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſermons and good preachers, edifying the people by their holy lives and wholſom doctrin, unto an emulation and care of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what thoſe people ſee and hear ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taught and practiſed by their pious preachers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe words of S. Chryſoſtom, <hi>If one ſpeak in an unknown tongue, he is a barbarian to himſelf and others,</hi> are abſolutely true. For ſo, if an Embaſſadour, or any other here in England, ſhould chatter words which neither himſelf nor
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57771:159"/>others underſtand, he would be a barbarian both to others and to himſelf too. But when your Diſſwader ſayes, that S. Chryſoſtom ſpake ſo, <hi>in order to a form of prayer, and urging the Apoſtles precept for it,</hi> he wrongs him wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For he does it not; nor can ſuch a ſaying have any place in ſuch a buſines. For the prieſt ſpeaks not in his liturgy to the people, as your Diſſwader ſimply imagines, but to God, where both ſpeaker and hearer underſtand. But the teſtimony of Lyra who is made to ſay, that in the primitive Church <hi>all things were done in a vulgar language,</hi> is falſified in the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For he ſayes not <hi>omnia</hi> all things, but <hi>communia</hi> common things, ſome parts in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, where the godfather or godmother makes a profeſſion of faith; ſomthing in churchings of women, benedictions, marriages, and ſuch like, as is yet in uſe amongſt Papiſts at this day, were ſo done. So that all the contents of this ſection, the teſtimonies your Diſſwader brings againſt this Catholik cuſtom, and your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders own inſultings, which I ſet down in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, together with his gloſſes upon thoſe teſtimonies, are either abſolutely fals or totally impertinent, and in one word unconſcionably ſlaunderous.</p>
            <p>But <hi>it is as poſsibly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to reconcile adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with the ſeventh Commandment, as Church ſervice in a language not underſtood, to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57771:160"/>chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And is it ſo? Let us look then into that ſtrange fourteenth Chapter; and ſee what it ſayes.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Follow after charity, and deſire ſpiritual giſts, but rather that you may propheſie.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>For he that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, ſpeaketh not unto men, but unto God, for no man underſtandeth him: however in the ſpirit he ſpeaketh myſteries.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>But he that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exhortation, and comfort.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>He that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in an unknown tongue edifieth himſelf: but he that propheſieth edifieth the Church.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>I would that you all ſpake with tongues, but rather that ye propheſied: for greater is he that propheſieth than he that ſpeaketh with tongues, except he interpret that the Church may receive edifying.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Now bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren if I come unto you ſpeaking with tongues, what ſhall I profit you except I ſhall ſpeak to you either by revelation or by knowledg, or by propheſying or by doctrin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>And even things without life giving ſound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the ſound, how ſhall it be known what is piped or harped.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. <hi>For if the trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>9. <hi>So likewiſe you, except you utter by the tongue words eaſie to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for he ſhall ſpeak unto the air.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>10. <hi>Ther are it may be ſo many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them are without ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>

                  <item> 11. <hi>Therfor if I know not the meaning of the voice, I ſhall be unto him that ſpeaketh a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a barbarian to me.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>12. <hi>Even ſo ye foraſmuch as ye are zealous of ſpiritual gifts, ſeek that ye may excell to the edifying of the Church.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>13. <hi>Wherefor let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>14. <hi>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayes, but my underſtanding is unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>15. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, I will pray with the underſtanding alſo.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>16. <hi>Els when thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſay Amen to thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>17. <hi>For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>18. <hi>I thank my God I ſpeak with tongues more than you all.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>19. <hi>Yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>20. <hi>Brethren, be not children in underſtanding, howbeit in malice be ye children, but in underſtanding men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>21. <hi>In the law it is written, with men of other tongues and other lips will I ſpeak unto this people: and yet for all that, will they not hear me ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>22. <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tougues are for a ſign not to them that beleev, but to them that beleev not: but propheſying ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not to them that beleev not, but to them who beleev.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>23. <hi>If therfor the whole Church be come

                  </item>
                  <item>24. <hi>But if all propheſie, and there come in one that beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>25. <hi>And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>26. <hi>How is it then brethren, when ye come together, every one of you hath a pſalm, hath a doctrin, hath a tongue, hath a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edifying.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>27. <hi>If any man ſpeak in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, let it be by two, or at the moſt by three, and that by cours, and let one interpret.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>28. <hi>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep ſilence in the Church, and let him ſpeak to himſelf and to God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>29. <hi>Let the prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judg.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>34. <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Churches, for it is not permitted to them to ſpeak, but they are to be under obedience, as alſo ſaith the law.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>35. <hi>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a ſhame

                  </item>
                  <item>36. <hi>What, came the word of God out from you, or came it unto you only?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>37. <hi>If any think himſelf a prophet or ſpiritual, let him acknowledg that the things I write unto you are the commandments of God the Lord.</hi>

                  <item>38. <hi>But if any be ignorant, let him be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>39. <hi>Wherfore brethren covet to propheſie, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> Thus runs this fourteenth Chapter in your own tranſlation. And if it do nothing at all concern Church-ſervice, why ſhould the Roman Liturgy be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to it, any more than adultery to the third commandment? Or what diſparagement is it to this ſervice, that it cannot be reconciled to that law which no way concerns it: If it do concern Church-ſervice, then muſt all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer and Service of our Proteſtant Church of England be aboliſhed; being as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to this rule, as you ſay adultery is to the ſeventh Commandment. Say which you pleaſe. If it concern not any Church-ſervice, you juſtifie as to this account the cuſtom of the Roman Church: if you ſay it do, you condemn your own.</p>
            <p>Truth is, the Spirit of our Lord magnified his primitive Church, when it began to ſpread and appear in the world, with many particular graces; that the Jew and Pagan might diſcern in it ſomthing extraordinary, and by that exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57771:162"/>ſign be induced to beleev that the founder of that Religion was no ordinary perſon: as gift of miracles, tongues, and propheſies. The new converts of Corinth ſeemed to be more pleaſed with the gift of tongues, than any other; and when they met together, fell a gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all at once, not two or three only, but more, and perhaps the greateſt part of them, all at one and the ſame time, as the Apoſtle here intimates, v. 23. one for example in the Congo language; the other that of Mexico, one Ethiopian, the other Arabian, one the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, another the Slavonian: and none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood another, nor could well hear one another for the confuſed noiſe, as we may gather by v. 2. and v. 11. and ſo became barbarians to one another. This gift then and ſpecial grace of Gods Spirit, though it might aſtoniſh a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, that ſhould look upon them, which was all that holy Spirit intended by it; yet it could not edifie him any further, or move him, if he ſhould be left to himſelf, to think otherwiſe of them, than that they were a company of mad gabling diſtracted people; eſpecially when he conſidered that ſome of them ſeemed to exhort, ſome to ſing, ſome to pray, and all in a cluſter at one and the ſame time, no man heeding the other, or underſtanding a word he ſaid, if he ſhould. And this diſdorder the Apoſtle here labours to rectifie in this whole fourteenth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57771:162"/>chapter. And it is manifeſt, that the apoſtle here neither ſpake nor thought of any Church-ſervice either in one language or other; but only of that temporal gift which is now paſt away long ago with the people that had it. Nor can it prudently be applied to any Church-ſervice that I know in the world. For there is no ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any where. Much leſs can it relate to any cuſtom of the Roman Church, where all the people are devoutly praying to one and the ſame God, in quiet and ſilence, both in ſpirit and underſtanding, heart and mind too; the prieſt knowing what himſelf ſpeaks or prayes; and the people underſtanding both what he acts and does in their behalf and his own, and what alſo they beg of God themſelves, either with words or without them. So that here is no kind of parity at all.</p>
            <p>Nay, if neither the Prieſt did underſtand himſelf what he ſpeaks, nor the people what they pray, both which are abſolutely fals, yet would the Apoſtle allow even that, as a good cuſtom, though not ſo perfect; ſo long as the words contained piety, and the heart ſtood pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected in pronouncing them. <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue,</hi> ſaith he v. 2. <hi>ſpeaketh not to men but to God, and though man underſtand not, yet in ſpirit he ſpeaketh myſteries.</hi> And again v. 4. he ſaith, that ſuch an one <hi>edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf:</hi> and v. 14. he teaches, that ſuch a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57771:163"/>
               <hi>ones ſpirit prayeth,</hi> though his mind or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not: and v. 17. that he <hi>gives thanks well.</hi> With theſe of our learned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle your Diſſwaders words throughout this his ſection, are I am ſure abſolutely irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable. For he ſaith, ſuch an one <hi>prayes</hi> only <hi>with his lips,</hi> and <hi>not in ſpirit;</hi> that there is <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affection nor edification in any ſuch prayer;</hi> and that the <hi>heart and ſpirit ſayes nothing and asks for nothing, and ſo receives nothing, which Salomon calls the ſacrifice of foools;</hi> thus ſpeaks your Diſſwader quite contrary to Apoſtolical ſobriety. And not that cuſtom, I ſhould think, but your Diſſwaders invectives againſt it are irreconcileable with this fourteenth chapter. Saint Paul ſayes, that <hi>ſuch a one prayes in ſpirit;</hi> the Diſſwader, that <hi>he prayes onely in his lips.</hi> Saint Paul, that <hi>he edifies himſelf;</hi> the Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>his ſoul has no benefit,</hi> and that there is <hi>neither edification, nor affection, or any good by ſuch prayers.</hi> Saint Paul, that <hi>he prayes well,</hi> and <hi>gives thanks well;</hi> the Diſſwader, that <hi>he does ill.</hi> But I need not ſtand upon this now. There is no ſuch thing in the uſe of the Roman Liturgy, where prieſts and people pray both in ſpirit and mind too, both with heart and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo.</p>
            <p>Only let me tell you thus much, that St. Paul in one verſe of this chapter checks your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and all his whole diſcours in this ſection:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57771:163"/>
               <hi>Linguis loqui nolite prohibere,</hi> ſaith he v. 39. <hi>Do not forbid to ſpeak with tongues.</hi> But your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader forbids, and labours here might and main againſt it. Doth the Apoſtle ſpeak here of Church-ſervice, or not? If he do, then Church-ſervice in an unknown tongue is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: if he do not, then one of this chapter is againſt Church-ſervice in an unknown tongue. Surely your Diſſwader did never ponder theſe things, as he ought. Nay, if this diſcours of the Apoſtle concern Church-ſervice, ſo that your Diſſwader hence may rightly gather, that the popiſh Maſs in an unknown tongue is irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with it, I may upon the ſame ground prove more ſtrongly, that S. Paul would have the popiſh Maſs in an unknown tongue to be practiſed; <hi>Volo omnes vos linguis loqui,</hi> ſaith he v. 5. <hi>I will that ye all ſpeak with tongues;</hi> or <hi>I would that you all ſpake with tongues:</hi> which is according to your Diſſwaders meaning, <hi>I will have you all turn Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>I would ye were all turned Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But laſtly, if this 14. chapter to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians be to be underſtood of Church-ſervice and Church-preaching and Church-praying, as this diſſwading Doctour would have it, then Sir muſt our Proteſtant pulpits and ſervice-pews all down; and the Quakers way muſt come up infallibly. For what ſaith the text here. <hi>Sive lingua quis loquitur, ſecundum duos aut ad multum
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57771:164"/>tres, &amp; per partes; &amp; unus inter pretetur: ſi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twm non fuerit interpres, taceat in eccleſia, ſibi autem loquatur &amp; Deo. Prophetae autem duo &amp; tres dicant, &amp; caeteri dijudicent. Quod ſi alii reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum fuerit ſedenti, prior taceat. Poteſtis enim omnes per ſingulos prophet ari, ut omnes diſcant &amp; omnes exhortentur. Et ſpiritus prophet arum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetis ſubjecti ſunt.</hi> This is the great reſult of this whole chapter: and the very utmoſt that the Quakers would have; and what they practice daily in their meetings. <hi>If any ſpeak in a tongue,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let it be by two, or at moſt by three, and that by cours; and let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep ſilence in the Church, and ſpeak to himſelf and God. Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judg; and if any thing be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace; for ye may all propheſie one by one; that all may learn, and all be exhorted or comforted. And the ſpirit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to Prophets.</hi> Let your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now ſpeak what he thinks; but ſpeak it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the good Quaker may as well hear him as the Papiſt: and ſpeak it ſo effectually, that as far as in him lies, all the whole three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms may be perſwaded, that this chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the publick Service of the Church. If this were once done, I beleev there would not be ere long ſo much as one by ſhop or miniſter left in the Land. And it were a leſs dammage to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57771:164"/>your Diſſwader, that adultery were reconciled to the ſeventh Commandment, than Church-ſervice to his fourteenth Chapter of Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</p>
            <p>Why ther is a language uſed in the Catholik liturgy, which though it be not the tongue of any one Countrey, yet it is the moſt univerſally known language of the whole Catholik family upon earth, is ſufficiently diſcourſed in <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> I need not ſtand here to repeat it. I muſt go on.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>Which is about Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that Image-worſhip, wherin Papiſts give the ſame worſhip to the pictures as is due to the thing repreſented, is another novelty, and that a heatheniſh one too, brought in firſt by Simon Magus, and then the Gnoſticks, againſt which writes Clemens Alexandrinus, and others: inſomuch that S. Cyril in the time of Emperour Julian, denies that Chriſtians did worſhip the Croſs, and Epiphanius is ſaid to have cut in pieces a cloth picture, wherin was the image of Chriſt or ſome Saint. And therfore the decrees of the ſecond Nicen Synod which had approved ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was abrogated by another general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel at Frankford; a little after which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, the Emperour ſent Claudius a godly preacher to preach againſt Images in Italy. And well he might, for the Councel of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57771:165"/>had long before that time declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And all the devices of Roman writers to palliate this crime are frivolous; for the pure primitive times would not allow the making of Images, as witnes Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Tertullian, and Origen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is much ado about a ſhadow. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Diſſwader could pick up, that might ſound but like his purpos, is here in a general maſs heaped up together, whether it do touch his purpos, or not at all concern it, or be haply againſt himſelf. Theodoret, forſooth, S. Auſtin and Irenaeus, theſe muſt all teſtifie, that Simon Magus firſt brought images into the Church, wherof they have not any one ſuch word. The ſame fathers with Epiphanius muſt accuſe the Gnoſticks and Carpocratians for the ſame thing; wheras they only blame them for placing the pictur of Jeſus and S. Paul with Homer, Pythagoras, Plato, Ariſtotle, and other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Clemens and Origen diſown and write againſt heathens Idolatry. So that all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not our purpos. The two Councels of Eliberis and Frankford are againſt him, and ſo is likewiſe S. Cyril who in the very place cited object extream ignorance to Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>who had caſt the Chriſtians in the teeth with their worſhipping a wooden Croſs, which they would not do to great Jupiter, and their painting the ima<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> foreheads, and afore their
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57771:165"/>houſes. And Saint Cyril tells Julian, that the Croſs put Chriſtians in mind of the vertue and good which Chriſt their Lord had done and ſuffered for them,</hi> which the good Doctour calls the <hi>precious and health-giving wood.</hi> And we may ſee not only by S. Cyrils anſwer, but by the objections of the Apoſtate Julian, what manner of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ther were in thoſe dayes, fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago.</p>
            <p>The Councel of Eliberis was kept in Spain, in the time of Emperour Galerius, when many Chriſtians by reaſon of the bitterneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecution, ſacrificed through fear unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods, and much contumely was done all over the world, and eſpecially in Spain, both to Chriſtians themſelves, and the holy Goſpel, and all ſacred things. Wherfor the Councel laid heavy pennances on all ſuch Chriſtians as ſhould ſo apoſtatize either into heathenſme, herefie, or the notorious ſin of adultery; and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, c. 36. ordained that <hi>no ſacred pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ſhould be painied upon the walls,</hi> becaus namely there they ſtood fixed, and were liable to the contumely of pagans, wheras ſuch as were in frames and tables, might eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and put into a ſafe place. That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Eliberis, becaus they adjoyn not a reaſon unto their decree, may eaſily be miſtaken; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the one may be diſcerned in the other, by a judicious and ſerious reader, <hi>Ne quod colitur
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57771:166"/>adoratur,</hi> ſaith the Councel, <hi>in pariotibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingatur.</hi> For the picture properly ſpeaking, terminates neither reſpect nor contumely, but the thing repreſented by it, which if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, muſt not receiv contumely, if it can be helped, from wicked men.</p>
            <p>But the Councel of Frankford I cannot but wonder, why your Diſſwader ſhould cite it as an enemy to Images. Did not that Councel conſiſt of Catholik or popiſh Prelates, 300. of them gathered together under the Legates of Pope Adrian the firſt; in which alſo the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charles the Great, as ſtout a Champion of the Roman Church as any ever was in the world, was actually preſent. <hi>O but Eginard, Hincmar, Amonius, Blondus, and others teſtifie that the ſaid Councel of Frankford condemned the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nicen Synod, wherin images were eſtabliſht, calling it an Antichriſtian aſſembly.</hi> But how can this be thought probable, nay I may ſay poſſible, of thoſe two Councels? being ſo near one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that ther were not above eight or nine years ſpace between them, and both of them under one and the ſame Pope Adrian the firſt. Can any beleev this, though twenty Eginards ſhould ſay it? But he is not found indeed to ſpeak ought of it. Hincmar ſayes, that they of Frankford condemned <hi>the Synod aſſembled at Nice without the Popes authority.</hi> But that Nicen Synod was both aſſembled and confirmed by the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57771:166"/>authority of that very ſame Pope who called and ratified this of Frankford. Blondus ſayes, that they <hi>abrogated the ſeventh Synod, and the Faelician hereſie de tollendis imaginibus.</hi> And none of them ſay, that they of Frankford call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Nicen Synod an Antichriſtian aſſembly, or that they publiſhed any book to that purpos. What ſtrange confidence then is this of your Diſſwader, to talk thus at random, without book, and beſides all rule, and againſt truth.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of aſſembling this Councel of Frankford were the miſdemeanours of Elipan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Byſhop of Tolledo in Spain. For Faelix Urgelitanus his Countreyman having conſulted Elipandus concerning that ſcholaſtick difficulty, <hi>Whether Chriſt as man ought to be called the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or only the adoptive Son of God,</hi> by means of his diſcours, and a book written by him upon that ſubject, beleeved and ſaid againſt the ancient language of the Church, that Chriſt was to be held an adoptive child of God, and not his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſon. And theſe two, together with Claudius Taurinenſis, who came to them from Italy, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all Spain with the clamour. This act of theirs was fond as well as wicked. For though in the ſchools it might haply be held, that Chriſt as man is not the natural but only the adoptive Son of God, if that particle <hi>as,</hi> be taken for a note of reduplication; yet they could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that beleevers have nothing to do with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57771:167"/>ſuch nice logical points. Theſe conceiv Chriſt altogether ſpecifically, as he is in himſelf. And ſo they had ever beleeved him to be the only begotten natural Son of God, and we <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

And therfor in a Councel at Ratisbone, Faelix by name was condemned, reſpect being then had to the perſon and dignity of the Archbyſhop of Toledo, and the other Byſhop. Faelix therfor was brought to the Emperour Charles his Court, who then wintered at Rheginum; where after a while, he humbly ſubmitted to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, there then met together; and from thence ſent to the preſence of Pope Adrian, in the Cathedral of S. Peter he publickly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his errour, and returned home to his own City. Elipand when he heard of all this, grew more violent than before; and laboured not only with his whole endeavour to reclaim Faelix to his former errour, but by letters patent and large dated to all the Byſhops of France and Germany, to draw thoſe two Kingdoms to his opinion. Wherupon Faelix returned again to his vomit. And leaſt the infection ſhould ſpread
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57771:167"/>any further, by the agreement of the Pope and Charles the Emperour, a Councel was called at Frankford. This was the very buſines and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Councel: wherby every one may diſcern himſelf not only the improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the ſaid Councel of Frankford, which purpoſely met together to maintain the honour of Chriſt, ſhould deface his figures; but the falſity alſo of this your Diſſwader, who tells us, that a while after this Councel of Frankford, Ludovicus ſon to Charles the great, ſent Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius a famous Oratour to preach againſt images in Italy, <hi>p.</hi> 60. Wheras Claudius had troubled Italy and Spain too, three or four years before that Councel, nay before the Councel of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone, which was two years before, and his way was condemned with himſelf both at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone and Frankford too.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, how in the name of God comes your Diſſwader here againſt ſo much reaſon to aver, that the <hi>Councel of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford declared againſt images,</hi> that they <hi>condemned the ſecond Nicen Synod, wherin the uſe of Images had been maintained,</hi> that they <hi>publiſhed a book wherin that Synod was declared Antichriſtian,</hi> and that <hi>Ludovicus Charlemains ſon ſent down Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius after that Councel to preach againſt Images in Italy.</hi> I know that other Proteſtants have been guilty too of ſome part of this his ſtory; ſo far at leaſt as to ſay in particular, that the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57771:168"/>Frankford Councel was againſt images. But they never ſet down any of that Councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration againſt them, nor is ther any extant. Binius, who ſet forth all the Councels at large, both ſhows and copiouſly proves, that the acts of the ſecond Nicen Councel were all confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Councel of Frankford; which is alſo averred by Alanus, Surius, Vaſquez, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other learned men. And ſince it is likely enough, that ſomthing was done in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel about Images, wherof ther is ſo much talk in the world, ther can nothing be thought more rational, than that Pope Adrian, whoſe legates preſided in both the Councels, ſhould according to the Churches cuſtom ſend thoſe decrees of Nice about the ſame time lately finiſhed, unto the Councel now at Frankford; that the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Nicen Councel might be made known to all the Weſt, by their acceptation and promulgation at Frankford. Which alſo that it was abſolutely done, and no other thing done but it, may ſufficiently be gathered by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Councel of Senon, which in the 14. of their decrees ſpeaks thus: <hi>Carolus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Francorum rex Chriſtianiſsimus in Francofordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſi conventu, ejuſdem error is Iconomachorum ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsit inſaniam quam infaeliciſsimus quidam Faelix in Gallias &amp; Germani as invexerat.</hi> And the ſame is ratified by Platina, who in the life of Pope Adrian, <hi>Biennio poſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Theophylactus &amp;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57771:168"/>Stephanus Epiſcopi inſignes Adriani nomine Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum &amp; Germanorum Synodum habuerunt, in qua &amp; Synodus quam ſeptimam Graeci appellabant &amp; haereſts Faeliciana de tollendis imaginibus abrogata eſt:</hi> as alſo by Paulus Emilius, who in his ſecond book <hi>de geſtis Francorum,</hi> ſpeaking of that Councel of Frankford, <hi>Et imaginibus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuus honor reſtitutus eſt.</hi> The like may be proved out of Blondus in his Decads, Sabellicus his Aeneads, Gabliſards Chronology, Alanus his Dialogues, Nauclerus, &amp;c. All which various teſtimonies joyned in one; together with the motives of that Frankford Councel; the great procurer and protectour of that Councel, Charles the great, an eminent Champion of the Roman Church; the Preſidents of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, Theophylact and Stephen, legates of the ſame Pope Adrian, who had lately finiſhed and confirmed the ſecond Councel of Nice, may ſuffice, I ſhould think, to refute the trifling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of this Diſſwader. But his confidence is greater in his readers light beleef, then either the weight or truth of his own words.</p>
            <p>But <hi>all the devices of Roman writers to palliate this their crime,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>are frivolous.</hi> What are theſe devices, and what is their crimes? Sir, where there is no crime, there needs not any palliating devices. Is it a crime to keep an image of Chriſt crucified for us, that we may be often put in mind of the good and vertue of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57771:169"/>his holy paſſion, and our fanſie aſſiſted and kept in at our prayers, within the compaſs of their object? This is the buſines Sir, ſpeak directly unto this, before you go any further. You will make all ſorts of prophane Images, either to ſome civil uſe or indifferent, or perhaps a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty end. This is no crime with you. If it be, how comes it to paſs, that never any byſhop or other miniſter in England, who ſcribble with ſuch a ſtiff impertinency againſt Popiſh Images, have never laboured at all againſt theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pictures. <hi>O but Proteſtants do not worſhip theſe pictures.</hi> Do they not? I would to God, that all good Catholiks could ſo heartily love, imitate, and worſhip thoſe bleſſed perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in their portraictures, as Proteſtants do theirs, who by ſuch amorous faces in their curious dreſſes are brought, I fear, too often on their knees. Motives to filthy iniquity, they may ſtand; but repreſentation of auſterity, of contemplation, of martyrdom, of divine exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, of charity, of our Lord Jeſus, and his Saints, theſe are popiſh, theſe are antichriſtian, theſe are abominable. If the God of holineſs will not have any ſacred figures to be made, ſurely he cannot allow laſcivious, prophane, and light ones. But though he do not, our Miniſters will. <hi>O but the Papiſts give the ſame worſhip to the repreſentation, and the thing repreſented.</hi> This your Diſſwader may gather haply by his own
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57771:169"/>experience. For the figure of a King, a father, and a wife, if they do raiſe any affections or thoughts, theſe muſt needs be ſo much differing, as the perſons repreſented are. For the ſhadow, figure, or repreſentation if we would ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right philoſophy, neither does not can terminate any ſuch reſpect, though it may its own. For example, (that I may declare this my ſpeech) put caſe I have three or four Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes before me, of a ſeveral make or form, and of a much differing art. All theſe four figures have but one and the ſame repreſentation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they repreſent but one and the ſame thing Chriſt Jeſus our Lord crucified for our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and redemption: and whatever good affection may ariſe in my heart upon the ſight and thought of it, muſt needs be the ſame to that repreſentation and thing repreſented: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is terminated upon the thing repreſented by means of the repreſentation of it. And that is but one and the ſame reſpect, though the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures be many. For the repreſentation or figure can terminate no ſuch thought, although it be a means of directing it. But yet all thoſe four figures have reſpects of their own, which they bound and terminate themſelves; by reaſon, for example, of the excellency of their colours, the material on which they are wrought, the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of art in limning every part to the life, and the proportions of the whole in its due and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57771:170"/>full meaſure. Theſe and ſuch like conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ended fully in the picture, without any conſideration had to its object repreſented. And they may be of ſuch concerment in the buſineſs, that a man may be moved to prefer one of thoſe four pictures before all the other three. This is that I mean Sir, when I ſay that a ſhadow, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or repreſentation neither does nor can ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate any ſuch reſpect as reſults naturally upon the ſamplar or prototype, though it may its own. And this is no ſophiſtry of Ariſtotle, but meer natural and vulgar reaſon, common to all mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O but the Papiſts make their pictures their gods.</hi> I, this is the talk of black miniſters in the dark, to fools and children; while they ſit warm in the Roman Catholik Benefices which they have invaded, it behooves them to ſay, what ever they can think againſt Popery, be it right, be it wrong, be it ſence or nonſence. All goes down by a people once inveigled. And if they be not ſtill kept warm in their miſtake, the miniſter is loſt. Good God, in what a world do we live! I did my ſelf beleev all this once. And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, when I firſt ſaw Roman Catholiks to tear their pictures ſomtime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and put them into the fire. It is no ſuch marvel, if Epiphanius ſhould tear a Saints picture, which your Diſſwader here tells us, although that ſtory be not found in that epiſtle of Epiphanius tranſlated by
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57771:170"/>St. Jerom, Roman Catholiks do it ordinarily. For they uſe picturs but as they do their prayer-books, and when they are ſo ſullied and worn they can uſe them no more, they are turned both into aſhes, which is the laſt end of picturs, books, and men. And the reſpect they give to pictures, is but the very ſame kind, with what they give to the holy Goſpels; ſave only that the Goſpel is looked on as the inſide, and a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix the outſide of their Redeemer; but both are ſtill but ſhadows of him.</p>
            <p>I could ſay more concerning this buſines, and make it appear both that Chriſtians have ever in all ages had images of their Lord and his Saints in their houſes and Churches, and how profitable and uſeful they are, and that they are neither againſt the will of God, nor any right reaſon. And this I could clearly prove out of S. Baſil, Euſebius Caeſarienſis, S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nazianzen and Nyſſen, S. Auſtin, Bede, Jo. Damaſcen, Athanaſius, Ambroſe, Chryſoſtom. But I have here ſaid enough, if I have enough demonſtrated, as I think I have, that your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader has ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>§. 9. <hi>Which is an appendage to the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Reprovs the picturing of God the Father and holy Trinity, which many of the holy Fathers ſpeak againſt, much to the blame of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, which in their Maſs-books and Breviaries, Portuiſes and Manuals picture the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57771:171"/>holy Trinity with three noſes, and four eyes, and three faces in a knot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Catholik Chriſtian Church hath ever uſed and approved of the uſe of Images, as well as ſpiritual books, yet they allow not of any abuſe in either. And Ordinaries, Byſhops, Viſitors, and Superiours in all places are to look to that. So that in this his appendage, as he calls it, your Diſſwader acts but the part of a good Viſitour, to blame and mend that which is amiſs; which muſt continually be done, and continually is done all over the Catholick world, as well in this, as other affairs. And if any Ordinary be negligent herein, he is worthy of blame. But Sir, this is nothing of Popery or Catholik Religion; which allows only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the uſe of pious figures, to forward our thoughts and deſires to that eternal felicity above, which ſo many holy Virgins, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, Martyrs, Apoſtles, Monks, Hermits, and pious Princes, portrayed all before our eyes, arrived unto, by their auſterities, alms-deeds, purity, faſtings, diſciplines, meditations, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and patient ſufferings, in love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their holy Redeemer, who is the prince, and leader, and crown of all thoſe his glorious Saints, redeemed and ſanctified by the vertue of his precious blood and paſſion, out of the thraldom of Satan and this wicked world. Nor has Catholik Religion ever deſcended unto
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57771:171"/>the particular cirumſtances of theſe figures. This belongs to the care of Biſhops and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. Catholiks have generally no figures, but of ſuch only, as once have lived amongſt them in their Church, either as head or members of it. Nor of many ages would byſhops permit the holy Trinity, eſpecially God the Father to be pourtrayed at all. And if now they ſuffer it, they have for it I make no doubt a ſufficient reaſon; eſpecially ſince they heed not at all, however your Diſſwader imagines, any natural ſimilitude in any of their pictures. If they be ſo made, as to raiſe the fanſie to thoughts above, and the love and vertues that may bring us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they care not whether, for example, Saint Bennet were a man juſt of that complexion, or Chriſt their Redeemer of thoſe direct features the limner has given him. They come not into their Churches, nor do they caſt their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their pictures for any ſuch end. And if God the Father be repreſented to their eyes, as he is to their ears, when he is called <hi>Father,</hi> I ſee no harm in it. If we may uſe ſuch a form of words, when we ſpeak to God, as this world we live in may afford our ears, why may not the eyes have ſuch an anſwerable form too. But this is a buſines, which your Diſſwader, if he were a Catholik, might well propound in the next general Councel, and do otherwiſe in the mean time, if ſo he pleaſe in his own Dioceſs.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57771:172"/>For neither books nor picturs can be uſed in any Dioceſs, but what the Ordinary of the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. And the Byſhop ſtill guides himſelf by the general doctrin and diſcipline, the faith and cuſtom, the tradition and laws of the Church in the whole mannagement of his care. And when theſe do not clearly deſcend to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which he is to deal with, he uſes therin his own diſcretion, going that way, if he do well, that he findes comes neareſt to the rule, as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſuperiours alſo do in their affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O but the Roman Church with much ſcandal, and againſt nature and the reaſon of mankind in their maſs-books and breviaries, portuiſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuels picture the holy Trinity with three noſes, and four eyes, and three faces in a knot.</hi> And do they ſo? I have ſeen I think as many Catholik coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and maſs-books, and breviaries, portuiſes, and manuels, as your Diſſwader ever did; and yet I never ſaw any ſuch picture therin all my life. He has been it ſeems an earneſt pryer into the front and faces of books. But did he not miſtake, tro<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> you? and take ſome <hi>fortune-book,</hi> written in old letters, for a maſs-book? and thence conclude, that all breviaries and maſs-books, portuiſes and manuels were ſtored with ſuch <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>gures. However it were, the picture was to blame. For three noſes and three faces ought to have more than four eyes. And if ther were but four eyes, I cannot ſee how ther
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57771:172"/>ſhould be three whole faces, although ther were there three noſes in it. But this is as good ſtuff, and as true, and as pertinent too, as any other part of this his book, which he calls a Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from Popery.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>Which is againſt Papal authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sayes, that the Popes univerſal byſhoprick is another novelty, though not ſo ridiculous, yet as dangerous as any other. And a novelty it is; for Chriſt left his Church in the hands of the Apoſtles, without any ſuperiority of one above another. And in the Councel of Jeruſalem, James and not Peter gave the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive ſentence. Chriſt ſent all his Apoſtles with the ſame whole power, as his Father ſent him. Therfor. S. Paul bid the byſhops of Miletum feed the whole flock. And well ſaid S. Cyprian, that the Apoſtles were all the ſame that S. Peter was. And this equality of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt deſcend to all byſhops, who ſucceed the Apoſtles in their ordinary power, as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for Chriſt. So then by the law of Chriſt one byſhop is not ſuperiour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Chriſt made no head of byſhops. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the byſhop is no ſtep, till you reſt in the great ſhepheard and byſhop of ſouls. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him every byſhop is ſupream in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and in all power which to any byſhop is given by Chriſt. And that this was ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in ancient times, is proved by Pope
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57771:173"/>Eleutherius his epiſtle to the byſhops of France, by S. Ambroſe, S. Cyprian, Pope Symmachus, S. Denyſe, Ignace, Gelaſius, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Fulgentius, and even Pope Gregory the great. Wherfor S. Paul expreſſy ſayes, that Chriſt appointed in his Church firſt Apoſtles, but not S. Peter firſt. Nor did Peter ever rule but by common councel, as S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom witneſſes. And it is even confeſt by ſom of the Romiſh party, that the ſucceſſion is not tyed to Rome, as Cuſanus, Soto, Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edo, Canus and Segovius. Nor was any thing known therof in the primitive times, when the byſhops of Aſia and Africa oppoſed Pope Victor and Pope Stephen; and all byſhops treated with the Roman byſhop as with a brother not ſuperiour, and a whole general Councel gave to the byſhop of C. P. equal right and preheminence with the byſhop of Rome. Finally, Chriſt gave no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obey the byſhop of Rome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably never intended any ſuch thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A man would ſurely think Sir, that this nail is knocked in to the head. What could be ſaid more? But to be brief with you. If all the other ſections of this your Diſſwaſive have ſaid nothing, this I may ſay ſpeaks ſomthing wors than nothing. For his reaſons are ſenceles; his teſtimonies either impertinent or manifeſtly againſt himſelf; and his whole diſcours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57771:173"/>to the laws and conſtitutions of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Proteſtant Church.</p>
            <p>To begin with the laſt: whether you look upon the ſtatutes and acts of Parliament, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Engliſh Church and government were firſt ſettled in England upon the reformation in the dayes of Edward the ſixth, and afterwards ratified: or the articles, canons, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were agreed upon by the byſhops and clergy, and confirmed both by King Edward, Queen Elizabeth, King James, and our good King Charles, we ſhall clearly ſee, that our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Proteſtant Church and government is Monarchical; and that byſhops are as much ſubjected to their Arch byſhops, as Miniſters to Byſhops; and Arch-byſhops in like manner to the King, in whom the Epiſcopal power is radical and inherent, and in whom is the fulneſs of eccleſiaſtical authority, and from whom by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops do receiv their place, authority, power, and juriſdiction. And that Parſon, Vicar, or other Doctour, who ſhall write or ſpeak contrary to this; by the conſtitutions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons eccleſiaſtical made in the time of our late good King Charles, he is to be ſuſpended; and by the Canons and conſtitutions eccleſiaſtical made and confirmed in the Reign of King James, he is excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> and by the laws of Queen Elizabeth and King Edward to be further puniſhed. How comes it then that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57771:174"/>this your diſſwading Doctour utterly diſſolves all this frame of government, under pretence of talking againſt papal power, as contrary to the mind and will of Chriſt; which will and mind is notwithſtanding moſt reſolutely aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſtitutions and laws of this our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Engliſh Church and Kingdom, which reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed the Roman ſeat and perſon, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſtill the power and ordination of Church-government; which finally reſted, now no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in any Roman byſhop, but in our own princely monarch. If any will but take the pains to look upon our conſtitutions and ſtatutes he will ſoon find all this to be moſt true. This your Diſſwader in deſpight of all our laws to the contrary, will have the government of Chriſts Church not to be monarchical; but a pure ariſtocracy, ruled by a company of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſtanding like a company of trees, all in a row, one by another, but no one between the other and heaven. An order he admits or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, according as. I ſuppoſe as one begins to count or number them, but no juriſdiction, no power, no autority, no ſuperiority of any one over the reſt. <hi>One byſhop,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to another, Chriſt made no head of byſhops. Beyond the byſhop is no ſtep, till you reſt in the great ſhepherd and byſhop of ſouls. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder him every by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is ſupream in ſpirituals, and in all power which to any byſhop is given by Chriſt.</hi> But the laws of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57771:174"/>the land and conſtitutions of our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, teach us on the contrary, that one byſhop is ſuperiour to another, and he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for called an Arch-byſhop; and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt ther is a head both of Byſhops and and Arch-byſhops: ſo that ther is one other ſtep yet, before you reſt in the great ſhepherd and byſhop of ſouls, even he who is under Chriſt ſupream head and governour of his Church in theſe his Majeſties realms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and that, under Chirſt every byſhop is not ſupream in ſpirituals, or <hi>in all power;</hi> mark, I ſay he is not ſupream in all power, which to any byſhop is given by Chriſt.</p>

And he is as much above them, as other ordinary byſhops are above a Presbyter or parochial miniſter. For in adminiſtring Sacraments, and preaching Gods word, every miniſter is impowred as fully as any byſhop: but the government of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or presbyters within the Dioceſs, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to one, who therfor has the name and title of byſhop, which ſignifies an Overſeer of the reſt. This byſhop admits of presbyters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pariſh, and when any pariſh is vacant, he ſees that one be put in: if any be careles and negligent in the duty of his pariſh, he firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes him like a father, and if he will not amend his manners, he puts him out, and furniſhes the place with a better paſtour: he judges the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints between pariſhioners and parſons, or between parſons or presbyters among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and decides them: he viſits and keeps chapter, or ſhould do at leaſt, and finds and ſpeaks, and puniſhes their faults. All theſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57771:176"/>things are contained in the office of a byſhop; which therfor argue him to have an autority, power, or juriſdiction over other Presbyters or paſtours within his Dioces: although he be a presbyter or paſtour himſelf; and a chief one too, that is to ſay, with a more ample and large autority, then any one of thoſe who be under him hath given them, and therfor called a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or overſeer by way of eminence. And if all theſe things do, as needs they muſt, argue not only an order or bare precedency, but a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and power of a byſhop over other presbyters; then muſt they needs conclude the ſame power to be in one byſhop over another, in him namely, who by way of eminency is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the byſhop</hi> or <hi>archbyſhop,</hi> or <hi>prime byſhop</hi> amongſt the reſt; who is as truly the byſhop of byſhops, as theſe are overſeers of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. For this prime byſhop is declared by the aboveſaid canon, to be enabled by vertue of his office, to have all the power and charge that other byſhops have; and then over and above that, firſt to place the byſhops elect, and ſeat them each one in their provinces; then to go over and viſit the whole province authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, which none of the byſhops under him can do: thirdly to ſee vacant ſeats ſupplied: fourthly, if ſuch byſhops as he ſhall find ſlow and negligent in their duty, after a fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhment, mend not, to put others in their
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57771:176"/>place: fiftly, to judg the complaints and cauſes of ſuch as appeal unto him from their own by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: ſixtly, to decide the controverſies that may happen between one byſhop and another: ſeventhly, to judg the accuſations that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any byſhop: laſtly, to call ſynods, and there conclude and decide what may ſeem beſt for the welfare and ſpiritual government of his province. Are theſe the works of authority, power, and juriſdiction, yea or no? If they be not, how can any autority or power be proved? For all power is proved by its act; or how in particular may it appear, that byſhops have any autority over their presbyters or miniſters? But if they be; then is ther more than <hi>a precedency or order amongſt byſhops:</hi> then did not <hi>Chriſt leav his Church in the hands of the Apoſtles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuperiority of one above another,</hi> as this Diſſwader talks: For the laws and conſticuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this our Church and Kingdom, do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly atteſt that this our Engliſh Church is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled according to the will of Chriſt, by arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhops and byſhops, which is abſolutely true; then alſo did not <hi>Chriſt ſend all his apoſtles with the ſame whole power;</hi> then were not <hi>all the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the ſame that Peter was;</hi> then did not <hi>an equality of power deſcend from the apoſtles to all byſhops;</hi> then is there <hi>a ſtep beyond the ordinary byſhop,</hi> nay two ſteps, before <hi>you come to reſt in the great ſhepherd and byſhop of ſouls;</hi> then, <hi>under
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57771:177"/>Chriſt is not every byſhop ſupream in ſpirituals, nor yet in all the power which to any byſhop is given by Chriſt;</hi> all this I ſay is true, whatſoever your Diſſwader talks againſt not only the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church and government, which was here for above a thouſand years together in England, but againſt the very frame and conſtitution of his own Proteſtant Church, wherof he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an unworthy member. But miniſters when they begin to talk againſt popery, they are ſo heedleſly earneſt, that they knock out their own brains; and either to get a benefice or honour in it, they deſtroy their own Church that gives it them. I can no more wonder now, that ſuch an one as Whitby, in his book written againſt worthy Creſſy, ſhould ſay ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that <hi>an archbyſhop hath no power or autority,</hi> and <hi>that his grace of Canterbury hath no juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as he there talks, <hi>impar congreſſus Achilli;</hi> ſince a man of ſuch renown, as Doctor Taylor, ſhould ſpeak the ſame here, and give the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and other Sectaries in the Land, ſuch a fair occaſion and preſident to undermine and overthrow that Church, which is but lately lift out of the ruins of their hands. The ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that proves the byſhop, an ordinary byſhop to be under none but immediately under Chriſt, will prove as much for a ſingle Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Presbyterian. And it is already done by the ſubtle pen of John Baſtwick, in his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticus
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57771:177"/>as praeſules Anglicanos,</hi> which book is ſo ſtrongly written both againſt Popiſh and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prelacy too, that upon the grounds on which all Proteſtants go, it can never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and upon the grounds Doctour Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor here layes, it is all of it in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and made good. What a ſtrange madnes is it for any one, that he may ſeem to weaken another Church, to overthrow his own. Truth is, here is no tye in England, that any one will be held with. The ſcriptur is in every mans boſom to make what he will of it. Ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, cuſtoms and councels they ſlight as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous. Their own conſtitutions and ſtatutes they do not ſo much as heed. What can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from hence but eternal diſſention and wars.</p>
            <p>Nay the miniſter to get his orders and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the biſhop to enter into his See, make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proteſtation of obedience and ſubjection. When they have got their ends, they wipe their mouths, and ſo far forget what they have done, that they write and act preſently, as if they had never thought any ſuch thing. See here the form of conſecration of byſhops preſcribed and uſed by our Engliſh Proteſtant Church. <hi>In the name of God. Amen.</hi> I N. <hi>choſen byſhop of the Church or See of N. do profeſs and promiſe all due reverence and obedience to the archbyſhop and to the Metropolit an Church of N. and to their ſucceſſours.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57771:178"/>So help me God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, ſubjection and obedience is due on one ſide, there muſt needs be autority, power and juriſdiction on the other. And that man, who hath One ſet over him with ſuch an authority under Chriſt, cannot be immediately under Chriſt himſelf; and if he affirm he is ſo, then <hi>ipſo facto</hi> doth he reject and rebel againſt that autority which in words he acknowledged. This is Dr. Taylors caſe, who teaches here, that <hi>by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles;</hi> and that ther was no <hi>ſuperiority amongſt the Apoſtles;</hi> that by the <hi>law of Chriſt one byſhop is not ſuperiour to another;</hi> that Chriſt <hi>made no head of byſhops;</hi> that <hi>beyond the byſhop is no ſtep, till you reſt in the great ſhepherd and byſhop of ſouls, &amp;c.</hi> What is this, but to reject all obedience and loyalty, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly vowed and promiſed? and to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the laws and conſtitutions of his own Church; and finally, which is wors than all the reſt, to give an example to diſaffected miniſters of doing the like?</p>
            <p>But how does he prove all this? very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly both by reaſons of his own, and autorities of other men. Only the miſhap is, thoſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing at all for him; theſe, very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But what are his reaſons? <hi>Byſhops are the Apoſtles ſucceſſours, and ther was no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour amongſt the Apoſtles.</hi> Mr. Baſtwick and ſuch as he will tell you, Sir, that <hi>prieſt, miniſter,</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:57771:178"/>and <hi>byſhop</hi> were but ſeveral ſynonomous words for one and the ſame thing upon divers reſpects: ſo that it is to be feared your Diſſwader hath proved too much here, and hath ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; but if he hath not proved too much, he hath proved nothing. I am ſure there was a ſuperiority amongſt the Apoſtles, and ſhall demonſtrate it by and by, as well as I can. In the mean time, how prove you ther was none? <hi>Chriſt ſent all his apoſtles with the ſame whole power, his father ſent him.</hi> Good Sir, our Lord ſayes indeed, <hi>as my father ſent me, ſo do I ſend you;</hi> giving them a legal commiſſion from him, as himſelf had from God his eternal Father. But that he ſent them every one with the ſame <hi>whole power,</hi> that is, ſo to teach and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, that they ſhould be ſubject to no one amongſt them, theſe are your Diſſwaders words, caſt in by fraud and fallacy, and no auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity evangelical; and therfor prove nothing. Nay if Chriſt had ſo ſent his Apoſtles, every one with the whole power of governing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then had he changed his fathers commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For he was ſent himſelf to be one head and governour; and yet he had then conſtituted many. But how can you dream, good Doctour, that Chriſt ſent his apoſtles, each one with all his whole power he had received from God, ſince the very chiefeſt of his power, which is to confer grace upon the miniſterial acts of his words and ſacraments, can not be given to man.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57771:179"/>You ſee how fondly as well as falſly you have foiſted in theſe words, <hi>with all his whole power.</hi> What follows next. <hi>S. Paul bid the byſhops of Miletum feed the whole flock.</hi> Pray Sir how many byſhops were ther, do you think, in that one, no huge town of Miletum. Baſtwick brings this for a proof, that byſhops and prieſts were all one thing in thoſe dayes. And if it be otherwiſe, the times are much changed. Then many byſhops ſerved one town; now many towns will hardly ſerve one byſhop. But you cut off the ſentence Sir, that it may ſound better for your purpos, and, which is wors, change it too. The Apoſtle charges them to <hi>attend to themſelves and all the flock, wherin the holy Ghoſt hath conſtituted them overſeers.</hi> Which laſt words becaus they limit both their care and your own argument, you thought it prudence to leav them out. Pray Sir, would you have any byſhop to enter upon anothers Dioceſs? What then would you have here, when you make S. Paul bid the paſtors all of them to feed all <hi>the whole flock,</hi> without any reſtriction? In all your heats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſtill your ſelf. Go on. <hi>The equality of power muſt deſcend to all byſhops, who are their ſucceſſours.</hi> I can eaſily grant you, that they have all of them equal power of adminiſtring Sacraments, and looking to their flock, every one within his own precincts. And this is all your diſcours infers. But an equality of power over one another, was neither amongſt the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57771:179"/>Apoſtles; nor yet here in our Engliſh byſhops, nor ever in the Church of God. How do you prove that? <hi>By the law of Chriſtone byſhop is not ſuperiour to another; Chriſt made no head of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: beyond the byſhop is no ſtep till you reſt in the great ſhepheard and byſhop of ſouls. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder him every byſhop is ſupream.</hi> This argument is in a mood and figure called <hi>Ita dico.</hi> You ſay ſo: and the ſtatutes and canons of the Church of England ſay no. Whom ſhall we beleev? I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prefer a Church before any one Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though he be in her, when he is againſt her. But <hi>S. Paul ſayes expreſly, that Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Church firſt apoſtles, but not S. Peter firſt.</hi> I marry Sir! now we are come to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument indeed. And it runs thus, <hi>According to S. Paul, the apoſtles were the firſt rank or dignity in the Church: but S. Peter was none of that rank or dignity; therfor he could not be firſt.</hi> Was not S. Peter then one of the apoſtles? or will you make it run thus? <hi>The apoſtles were the firſt rank or dignity in the Church, but S. Peter was not that rank or dignity, therfor he was not firſt.</hi> This is indeed the ſurer way. Becaus no one man can be reckoned for a rank or dignity, or ſo many perſons in the plural number. This is an argument never yet thought of in Oxford or Cambridg, to prove they have no ſuperiour either over all, or over any one Colledge. Not over all: For ther be firſt Colledges, then
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57771:180"/>Halls, then Inns, &amp;c. therfor the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour is not firſt. Not over one Colledge: For ther are firſt Fellows, then Schollars, then Penſioners, &amp;c. and therfor Mr. <hi>ſuch a one</hi> who is neither fellows, ſchollars, nor penſioners is not firſt. So here, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>ſet in his Church firſt of all apoſtles,</hi> therfor ſaith our learned Doctour, <hi>not firſt S. Peter, and ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily apoſtles, but all the apoſtles were firſt.</hi> The apoſtles were the firſt rank of dignity, good Sir, but that rank had order in it too. And ſo ther might be place for a firſt man, even in the firſt rank. But <hi>Peter did never rule but by common councel, as S. Chryſoſtome witneſſes.</hi> He ruled then good Sir, it ſeems he ruled then. Will you bring this for an argument of his not ruling? You are ſhrewdly put to it in the mean time. And if he ruled and governed and mannaged all by common councel, he was the better ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour for that; but not therfor no ſuperiour. Will you admit no rulers but tyrants, who do all by their own will. But <hi>even ſome of their own popiſh writers do grant, that the ſucceſsion is not tied to Rome, as Cuſanus, Soto, Canus, Driedo, Segovius.</hi> What does that opinion of theirs, if they did ſay ſo, prove againſt the ſovereignty of one byſhop over the reſt, which is the only thing now in hand, wherever he reſide? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be thought to ſpeak againſt our Engliſh monarchy, although I ſhould haply ſay,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57771:180"/>that the King is not bound to reſide ſtill at Weſtminſter. The papal paſtour hath ever ſince S. Peters time, ever reſided yet in that Roman Dioceſs, which Catholiks do indeed conſider as a thing ſomwhat ſtrange; ſince all other apoſtolical Sees beſides that, are failed and gone; but no man knows the diſpoſition of divine providence here on earth for future times. Perhaps that Roman See, I mean the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Roman Dioceſs ſhall ſo remain to the worlds end; and perhaps again it may not. And if it ſhould not, or if that whole City ſhould be deſtroyed, or Chriſtian Religion in it; or if the City and all the whole Kingdom of Italy ſhould lye under the ocean, quite overwhelmed and drowned, yet ſo long as the world laſts, ther ſhall be a Church of Chriſt on earth; and ſo long as ther is a Church, ther will be one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream paſtour of it, where ever he reſide. And this is that which ſom Catholik doctours mean, when they ſay that the ſucceſſion is not tied to Rome. What doth this make to your purpos Mr. Diſſwader? Go on then. <hi>No papal ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty was thought of in primitive times, when the byſhops of Aſia and Africa oppoſed Pope Victor and Pope Stephen.</hi> Does an oppoſition infer a nullity of power? Then Sir ther would be no power upon earth either eccleſiaſtical or civil; which are all reſiſted one time or other. Was there no royalty or byſhops in England ſo much
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57771:181"/>as thought of thirty years ago, when they were both of them more than oppoſed by the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What miſerable ſhifts are theſe! You may find, and I am confident you do find and know well enough, that even in thoſe times you ſpeak of, and before and after them, the papal power was acknowledged and reverenced by the whole world: and yet you will take advantage of a diſpute, that happens more or leſs in all ages, to ſay againſt your conſcience, and from thence infer, that the papal power was not ſo much as thought of in thoſe primitive times. God keep you Sir from conteſting with any of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. For if you do, this argument of yours will prove, that your autority in your own hous was not ſo much as thought of in thoſe dayes, either by you, or them, or any els. Have you any thing els to ſay? <hi>A general Councel of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon gave to the byſhop of C. P. equal rights and preheminence with the byſhop of Rome.</hi> What ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel was that? and who is that C. P. and what were thoſe equal rights univerſal over all, or by way of ſimilitude over ſome? A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable may have given him equal rights and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in his leſſer charge unto ſom purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as a King hath in his whole Kingdom: what then? If this prove any thing, it is, that there is a ſovereign power over all, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to which, in meaſured out the right and authority of another in order to one particular.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57771:181"/>But <hi>all byſhops ever treated with the Roman Byſhop as with a brother, not as a ſuperiour.</hi> As bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſuperiour too, he both treated with them and they with him, as I could eaſily ſhow at large. But to a bare fals affirmation one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle negation will ſuffice. <hi>Chriſt gave no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to obey the byſhop of Rome, and probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended any ſuch thing.</hi> He commanded and probably intended, that all ſhould obey thoſe <hi>that were ſet over them.</hi> Is not that enough? I pray you Sir tell me, did he give any command to obey the byſhop of Canterbury here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or the byſhop of Armagh in Ireland, or probably ever intend any ſuch thing? Speak out. If he did, the Roman Prelate will challenge obeyſance upon the ſame title: if he did not, then is your promiſe and vow in epiſcopal ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation infignificant and fond. But <hi>James and not Peter gave the deciſive ſentence in the Councel at Jeruſalem.</hi> And why ſay you ſo? How prove you that his words and not the other were deciſive, when one of them did but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the other.</p>
            <p>Now ſince your Diſſwader hath proved after his manner, that ther is not any one ſovereign byſhop over all, pray give me leav Sir to let you know, why I think on the contrary, that one ſuch there is and ought to be.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>monies, which are in this point innumerable, I ſhall for brevities ſake only uſe two reaſons.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57771:182"/>The firſt is: That Chriſt our Lord would have the whole company of Chriſtians upon earth ever to be and remain one flock. This I conceiv can never be, except they be all under one viſible paſtour. Nor can it ſuffice to ſay here, that they are all under one Chriſt and one God: For this can never make them all, either really to be, or truly to be called one flock on earth. All the Kingdoms and people in the world, however they be governed, are under one God the ſupream King, as the whole Church is ſaid to be under one Chriſt: but this makes them not to be one Kingdom. Nay, thoſe that have not a viſible King, are not any Kingdom at all; but an ariſtocracy only, or commonwealth, or wild ſtraglers. But if you will have no viſible flock of Chriſtians upon earth, you teach the Quakers doctrin, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all government. It is certain then, that if the eccleſiaſtical government of each place, do end in the byſhop of that reſpective Dioceſs, as the Diſſwader talks, that ther muſt be then as many flocks of Chriſtians, as there be byſhops upon earth; which being not ſubordinate all of them to one general paſtour, can never bring their flocks into one.</p>
            <p>Second is, That ſuch a polity and government muſt ever be preſerved in Chriſts Church, which himſelf ſet up and practiſed. This is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For if that polity or body be changed, it
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57771:182"/>is no more Chriſts polity or Chriſts body, but that other, whatever it be which is introduced in his place, and the body of that man or men that introduced it: from whence alſo it receivs its name; as from Luther, his followers are called Lutherans, and Calviniſts from Calvin: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the laws, which do ever follow the condition of the government, muſt alter with it. Thus it was with us here in England the other day. When our government was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, we were no more the body of William the Conquerour, or any polity inſtituted by him; but another polity or body, ſet up by the Rump-Parliament; and all our laws became then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their arbitrary interpretation, to be wreſted as themſelvs pleaſed. And they had been, if we had continued a while longer in that ſad condition, by degrees utterly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All this not our reaſon only, but heavy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will acknowledg for a certain truth. But Chriſt our Lord did aſſuredly both ſet up and practiſe himſelf a viſible ſovereignty over all the whole flock of Chriſtians, which he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together from other viſible companies of Jews and Pagans. And therfor muſt ther ſtill and ever be, ſom one viſible paſtour over this one flock unto the worlds end. For if that polity or body change, then is it no more Chriſts body, but another thing. And his laws and religion will be then interpreted according
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57771:183"/>to the pleaſure of thoſe who firſt rejected the government, and of their followers afterward, unto infinite and endles miſery.</p>
            <p>And that this polity or government is ever to remain in Chriſts Church on earth, may be gathered, firſt by this; That every wiſe legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour knows well enough, that all his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him look upon his example, as their rule to ſteer by ever after, ſo long as they mean to preſerv his way, and be of his body. Thus, when any ſtate is once founded either in ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, democracy or monarchy, the founder of ſuch a ſtate has no need to tell the people, what he would have them to do afterwards; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould choos themſelvs one governour or many; where they have his clear example to walk by. They will naturally follow his ſteps therin, ſo long as they mean to preſerv the ſtate he has eſtabliſhed. Now the Apoſtles and all his diſciples and beleevers knew and ſaw, that the Church of Chriſt, which is his ſtate ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, was founded by him in monarchy, or the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of one over all. And therfor as ſoon as our Lord ſpoke to them of his own departure, they began all of them naturally to think of one, who ſhould ſucceed in his general care, and who that one ſhould be. Nor did they doubt whether one ſhould be over all the flock, but who ſhould be that one, that ſhould preſide and overſee it. And to prevent the faction, our
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57771:183"/>Lord, as Catholik tradition teaches, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpel not obſcurely inſinuates, pointed out one; giving him withall a good rule of humility and charity to remain for after ages, <hi>That he that is greateſt among them ſhould be as the leaſt,</hi> moſt humble, moſt ſerv<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceable, moſt full of obſervance and charity: which rule if that chief paſtour obſerv not, he is the more to blame. And all ages have ever looked upon the ſucceſſour of that chief apoſtle, as Vicegerent of our Lord and maſter; under whom they are united in one flock, and ſo keep their laws and religion ſtill one, and intirely the the ſame, from age to age; however they lye divided in place and time under ſeveral byſhops up and down the world. Wheras all others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this one Catholik flock, run into ſeveral bodies; and by their various interpretations, diſſolv by little and little, according as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs increas, all the whole frame of ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Secondly, it may be gathered by this, that Chriſt our Lord inſtituted a monarchical government of his Church, ruled ſo long as he lived by one; and therfor muſt that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever remain. He ſet it up to remain. For ſurely he did not ſet it up to be pulled down again. Thirdly, becaus there is no power on earth to change it. What God has conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, man cannot undo, lawfully I mean he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
            <pb n="362" facs="tcp:57771:184"/>
            <p> Now we have no ſuch body of Chriſtians in England, that remain under one who is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſtour over all the Chriſtian flock in the world, or do ſo much as pretend it, ſave only the few Roman Catholiks, that are yet here left alive, by the ſtrange providence of that God, unto whoſe univerſal Church they have ſtill adhered, notwithſtanding the greateſt trials that ever poor Chriſtians were put to. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quaker, Anabaptiſt, or Independent, Presbyterian or Prelate-Proteſtant do ſo much as pretend to any ſuch thing; but they all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. And as they do not pretend to belong to any general body, that hath a viſible head overſeeing the whole flock of Chriſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world; ſo neither is any of their Church-governments monarchical in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective place, if we may beleev themſelvs. I know our Engliſh Proteſtant Church was firſt appointed in the dayes of King Edward and Queen Elizabeth to be reſpectively monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that is to ſay, within the precincts of this Kingdom, the hierarchy ending in the Kings majeſty, who is doubtles the ſupream head and governour both of the Proteſtant Church and the temporal or civil ſtate, in all theſe his three Kingdoms. But indeed and truth none of them acknowledg it. For they do not, any of them, expect, as they ought all of them to do, a full deciſive ſentence from the Kings Majeſties lips
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57771:184"/>in all their controverſies or doubts of faith; nor will they acquieſce in his judgment: which is a ſtrange mad refractorines in our nation, and contrary to our own principles. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents laſt tribunal is in the light of his own breaſt. The Presbyterian will not look beyond his Presbyteral Conſiſtory. And the Prelate-Proteſtant writer, which I moſt marvel at, ends all in the byſhops, allowing no autority, power or juriſdiction to their Archbyſhops, but only an order and decent precedency for manners ſake, which in effect is wholly to diſſolve the conſtituted frame of Church-government in this land. They ſpeak not indeed of the Kings majeſty, for fear I ſuppoſe of the rod God hath put into his hands. But it is not hard to gather both by their words and actions, what they think. Whitby of late wrote a book againſt Dean Creſſy; and there he ſayes expeſly, that an Arch-byſhop <hi>hath a decent precedency, but no authority;</hi> and that his <hi>Grace of Canterbury hath no juriſdiction;</hi> and that the Kings Majeſty is not the root of Epiſcopal juriſdiction here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: And yet he was approved and praiſed even by our Proteſtant byſhops. Do they not ſee, that <hi>à pari,</hi> nay <hi>à fortiori</hi> the ſame be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our byſhops? that they have no autority, and that they have but a decent precedeney over Presbyters, and that they are not the root of eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction. With what a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57771:185"/>ſtrange blindnes are our eyes poſſeſt! Nay, this great Diſſwader an eminent man among Prelate-Proteſtants, here teaches publickly, <hi>that byſhops are all ſupream under Chriſt.</hi> So that this our Church-government by byſhops, can be no other but Ariſtocracy: the Presbyterians a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy; and the reſt a plain Anarchy, every man thinking and acting what is good in his own eyes. And none of theſe, who are all fallen from the general flock and general paſtour, heed unto effect, any one thing that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, either ſtatutes canons laws, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or ought els. But God bleſſes his true Church with a true obedience. Thus I have given you Sir my reaſon, why I think ther is and muſt be one general paſtour over all the whole flock of Chriſtians. Pray ponder it well. Brief I am in it, becaus it is beyond my general deſign, which is only to ſhew, that Doctour Taylors Diſſwaſive from Popery is inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the teſtimonies your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader cites for himſelf; which I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are above half of them impertinent, and the reſt, if he had not fraudulently maimed them, flatly againſt himſelf. As for the firſt ſort, your Diſſwader imagining in his head, that the Apoſtles had no ſuperiour, which is the grand falſity on which all his whole diſcours runs, brings all thoſe authors who either ſay,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57771:185"/>that <hi>byſhops are the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles;</hi> or that they had <hi>received the keyes of heaven;</hi> or that <hi>they are not to be contemned,</hi> and the like, for witneſſes of his opinion, as Irenaeus, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Anacletus, Clemens, Hieronimus, Gregorius, and various others. All this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. But the other autorities, had they not been curtaild and perverted by him, had openly and plainly ſpoken that Catholik truth, which he here oppoſes; namely that the <hi>Apoſtles had a ſuperiour;</hi> and that all <hi>the whole Chriſtian flock have and ought to have one general paſtour,</hi> and that <hi>he ever hitherto hath ſate ſince S. Peters death in the Roman See.</hi> I know it would be worth my labour to ſet down all thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by him here cited, at large as they lye in thoſe Catholik Fathers and Divines: as apt at one and the ſame time to convince this his whole ſection of falſity, and the Catholik do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to be no novelty, as he ſayes it is. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus this is already done by the above-named Catholik Gentlemen, who with a greater pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than I am maſter of, turned over thoſe many ancient authours, I will content my ſelf with only the firſt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the whole new teſtament,</hi> ſaith your Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>ther is no act or ſign of ſuperiority; or that one apoſtle exerciſed power over another: but to them whom Chriſt ſent, he in common intruſted the Church of God, according to that excellent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57771:186"/>of S. Cyprian, the other apoſtles are the ſame that S. Peter was, indowed with an equal fellowſhip of honour and power, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the excellent ſaying of S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>The other apoſtles are the ſame that St. Peter was, indowed with an equal fellowſhip of honour and power.</hi> And he cites it out of <hi>his epiſtle de unit. Eccleſiae ad Novatian.</hi> But did S. Cyprian either ſay or mean by that ſaying, ſo much of it as is S. Cyprians, that ther was no ſuperiority among the apoſtles, or that the Church of God was intruſted to them in common? Nay, does not S Cyprian uſe thoſe words in a diſcours wherin he endeavours induſtriouſly to declare, that there was a ſuperiority among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; in which as in a cone of unity they were all united, although they were all alike in power and commiſſion of adminiſtring Sacraments. If it be ſo, what ſhall we think of this Diſſwader, and of his excellent ſaying of S. Cyprian, to prove that the Church was intruſted to the apoſtles in common; and that no one apoſtle exerciſed a power over another. The text of S. Cyprian runs thus. <hi>Our Lord ſaid to Peter, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock will I build my Church, and again feed thou my ſheep. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the one Him Chriſt builds his Church, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him he commends his ſheep to be fed. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though after his reſurrection he gave to all his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles equal power, and ſaid, as my father ſent me, ſo I ſend you; yet that he might manifeſt unity,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57771:186"/>he conſtituted one chair, and by his authority diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the origen of unity beginning from one. The other apoſtles are the ſame that Peter was, &amp;c. But the beginning comes from unity, the primacy is given to Peter, that one Church of Chriſt and one flock of Chriſt may be monſtrated.</hi> Thus St. Cyprian teſtifies of the apoſtles, that although they were all equal in their ſpiritual commiſſion of Gods word and Sacraments, yet were they brought to an unity by the government of one ſuperiour, and one chair which overſaw them all. And is this a fit place to prove, that the Apoſtles had no ſuperiour over them, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly teſtifies that they had one? In the ſame manner doth our Diſſwader deal with the other teſtimonies. But I have been too long upon this point. Here is enough Sir to let you ſee, what I ſaid in the beginning of this diſcours, that your Diſſwaders reaſons are ſenceles; his teſtimonies either impertinent or manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; and his whole talk and doctrin contrary to the laws and conſtitutions of our own Proteſtant Engliſh Church.</p>
            <p>§. 11. <hi>Which concludes the novelties.</hi>

               <q>Gives notice of nine other popiſh novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Saints invocation, Scripture-inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, abſolution before pennance, Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, nine-penny-maſſes, circum geſtation of Euchariſt, intention in Sacraments, maſs-ſacrifice, and communionleſs maſs.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="368" facs="tcp:57771:187"/>
            <p> After your Diſſwader has mentioned theſe to ſhow the fertility of his brain, he ſayes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them at all, but only that <hi>they be alſo innovations;</hi> and thence concluds, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion is neither <hi>old nor primitive nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik,</hi> and that it is <hi>eaſier for Proteſtants to tell where their religion was before Luther, then for Papiſts to tell where their religion was before Trent.</hi> And that when <hi>the enemy had ſowed theſe tares, and honeſt men in the Church durſt not complain, then England and other nations by the glaſs of Scriptur reformed to pure antiquity, preferring a new cure before an old ſore.</hi> In the beginning of the ſection it was a new ſore, in the end it is an old ſore, ſo long time was he a writing this one no-ſection. And he has ſo ordered the buſines, that it will be hard now for Papiſts to ſhow their Religion before Trent, although he has neither deduced the original of theſe nine or his other ten novelties from Trent, nor can ever ſhow that theſe or they are the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For as he has handled them, ther is not one of them any part of their Religion; much leſs doth their religion conſiſt in them. His firſt buſines of the power of making articles (ſect 1.) is ſo far from religion, that it is not ſo much as the philoſophy of any one ſchool in the Catholik world. His leaſh of new articles, (ſect. 2.) is partly a fond dream, and partly an erroneous viſion of his own. His diſcours of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57771:187"/>Indulgences (ſect. 3.) is utterly beſides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos; and what ther is of Catholik faith in it, he allows himſelf as ancient. 4. His talk of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is ſo ridiculouſly abſurd, that granting all that Roman faith teaches, to be both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and univerſal; he yet ſayes at random, that Roman faith is not that, and yet never ſpeaks himſelf what that Roman faith is. 5. In Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation he wholly playes with the word, which he knows when it came in, wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the thing it ſelf; and brings a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Popiſh Doctours that own it not for their faith, and not any one popiſh man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that own it: he ſayes it was defined in the Lateran Councel firſt; and yet is not that which was defined in the Lateran Councel, and never ſpeaks what this thing is, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he will have called Popery. 6. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of half-communion, as he calls it, is no Popery at all, that is to ſay, no Catholik faith, but a cuſtom only in the exerciſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that neither univerſal for time or place. And although Catholiks beleev, that it is not neceſſary to communicate in both kinds, yet do they not beleev, that it is neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate only in one kind, either this kind or that; but have uſed all the three wayes. 7. His diſcours about ſervice in an unknown tongue is a like miſtake, taking cuſtom for religion, and diſcipline for doctrin; and he perverts and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57771:188"/>falſifies the cuſtom too, ſaying that Papiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not their own prayers, nor know what they ask of God. 8. His talk of images paſſes by all the uſe of them that religion requires, and is wholly taken up in ſome ſchool diſputes and his own lies. 9. His exceptions againſt the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the Trinity with ſo many eyes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and faces in a knot, is as much popery as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clids</hi> book <hi>de Triangulis.</hi> 10. His ſection about the ſovereignty of one byſhop over all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had been about popery and catholik religion indeed, if he had handled it right; but as his reaſons are fond, and autorities fals; ſo he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes the very thing it ſelf, imagining that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts beleev that ſpiritual ſupremacy to be tied to the walls of Rome, which is no faith of theirs, and conſequently none of their popery. And ſo none of his ſections, nor any part of his diſcours touches either all or any part of Papiſts religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And is not this a doughty piece of work to prove popery, by which all his readers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Roman Catholik religion, to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old, nor primitive, nor apoſtolical? How he would have handled the other nine points, becaus he ſays nothing of them, I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf to read. But I am ſure that ſeven of the nine have not any relation to Catholik reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; all of them I mean beſides <hi>Saints invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs.</hi> What Councel hath determined, or what Catholik beleevs, that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57771:188"/>the ſacred ſcripture is inſufficient; or that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ought to be given before pennance; or that ſingle prieſts are to confirm; or that maſſes are to be ſold for nine pence; or circum geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or any ſuch intention in ſacraments as to damn folks, which the Diſſwader here ſpeaks; or that maſs is to be without communion. And I may now think, if he had ſpoke of the other two, <hi>Saints invocation</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he would even there alſo have miſtaken and ſtrayed. For he has ſo behaved himſelf hitherto, as though he were reſolved not to ſpeak any one word true or to the purpos. And yet he would ſeem to do it, perhaps on the ſame motive, that Sir <hi>Toby Matthews</hi> flitted from the richer byſhoprick of Durham, to that of York, <hi>becaus,</hi> as he himſelf gave the reaſon, <hi>he wanted Grace.</hi> But Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> muſt remember his own doctrin, that an Archbyſhop, although he have <hi>Grace,</hi> yet he has no <hi>juriſdiction</hi> with it: and it is a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is better, to have power without grace, or grace without power. He is well enough as he is, if he could be content. But ambition and covetouſnes will know no bounds.</p>
            <p>And as your Doctor in this his Diſſwaſive prattles about a Popery which is no part of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik religion; ſo does he wholly paſs by their chief religion, which is in a manner their whole popery; and all their religious cuſtoms attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; not that, only which the firſt reformers
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57771:189"/>allowed of; as their faith of one God, all power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, moſt wiſe and good, who made all things viſible and inviſible, and by his providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in their being, who in the fulnes of time ſent his beloved ſon to reconcile the world to himſelf, &amp;c. but that alſo which they rejected and principally inveighed againſt: as firſt internal ſanctification and renovation of our ſpirits; which was the end of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the world, the efficacy of his grace in our hearts, and the intention of his counſels and laws: ſecondly, the comfort, merit and neceſſity of good works, unto which holy goſpel by all ſweet promiſes invites us, Gods holy ſpirit moves, the very excellency of mans nature and condition ſuggeſts, the name and profeſſion of Chriſtian calls for, and future happines requires. Theſe by the firſt Proteſtants were all cried down as mortal ſins, and of no value at all in the eyes of God; by which doctrins they debauched mankind, and made men ſo diſſolute, careleſs and licentious, that if good nature, right reaſon, and the gracious working of God in our hearts had not more force upon ſome, than the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the firſt Proteſtancy, earth had become a meer hell by this. Thirdly, he paſſes by the prieſthood, altar and ſacrifice, which Chriſt our Lord inſtituted for our daily atonement in the figuration of his holy paſſion; at which old Chriſtians with all fear and reverence offered up
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57771:189"/>their daily praiſes, requeſts, and ſupplications to God, for themſelves and allies and whole Church of Chriſt; for all diſtreſſed perſons, for kings and princes, and for all men, that we may lead a quiet and godly life in this world. Fourthly, the ſeven ſacraments of Chriſts; which are ſo many conduits of ſanctification for our ſeveral neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for all conditions of men, and for all degrees of ſpiritual comforts. Fifthly, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of vows, which any ſhall freely make for Gods glory and his own advancement, in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in continency, in charity; and the bleſſed condition of ſinging and praiſing God in mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical retirement. Sixtly, the communion and union of the whole body of Chriſtians under one viſible paſtor; by whom they are aptly knit and compaginated together into one flock and body of Chriſt; however they may differ other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis in countrey, language, laws, civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other affections. Sevently, the marks of the true Church, and the autority ſhe hath to keep her people in unity of faith and obſervance of their Chriſtian duties. Eightly, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of original ſin and actual tranſgreſſions; which, however we may have heard of Chriſtian faith, and beleev it to be true, may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exclude us eternally from the bliſs of heaven now opened to beleevers, ſuch, as by mortifying ungodly luſts ſhall render themſelves conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Lord and head, who is aſcended
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57771:190"/>into heaven, and gone before to prepare there a place for them in bliſs with himſelf. Ninthly, the neceſſary concurrence of Gods grace and mans will unto his juſtification, and ſanctity and future glory in him; <hi>Qui creavit te ſine te, non ſalvabit te ſine te,</hi> as good S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks. Tenthly, the neceſſity and great benefit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, alms-deeds and faſting, which is practiſed in the Catholik Church, and commended to all as worthy fruits of that religion, which labours to root out, pride of life, concupiſcence of eyes and concupiſcence of fleſh thereby: and our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exact juſtice in all our contracts and dealings with our neighbour. Eleventhly, the danger of living and dying in ſin to ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſtianity, and uſeleſnes of faith without the good works of grace attending it. Twelftly, the poſſibility of keeping Gods commandments with the aſſiſtance of his grace. Laſtly, not to mention more, the great duty incumbent upon all Chriſtians, when, led away by the deceit of Satan, fleſh and this wicked world they ſhall chance to have ſtrayed from their holy rule, to ſet all ſtreight again by humble confeſſion, reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and other penal ſatisfactions for their fault. Theſe and ſuch like principles of ancient Chriſtianity, our firſt reforming Proteſtants, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> with other their companions, all apoſtate prieſts from the mother Church, ſo ſtifly cryed down as notorious popery, that they
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57771:190"/>have thereby corrupted the whole world. But your Doctour in this your Diſſwaſive from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, takes no notice of them at all. Proteſtant writers, however loth to practiſe them, yet aſhamed they are now to ſpeak againſt good works, as their fore-fathers did. Indeed every one of them that upon the hope of a richer benefice writes againſt Catholik Religion, makes both a new Popery, and a new Proteſtancy too; and while they ſpeak in general againſt that, they may ſay in particular of this, what they pleas. For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had never any Councel to make them all agree, how much of Popery they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or what they ſhould poſitively eſtabliſh: nor ever will nor can have; nor do they care, ſo they keep but their livings and places that they have extorted from Catholik hands, which they know they cannot keep, except by libelling againſt Popery they get the power of the land, honeſter and better men then themſelvs to back and ſupport them in their wayes, whether any thing be ever ſettled or no.</p>
            <p>I ſhould alſo here ſet down the ſubſtantial cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Catholik Chriſtians, in their chappels and churches, oratories, and private houſes, wholly neglected by the Diſſwader, though they be in the hearts and hands of them all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole earth. If he had declared either their ſubſtantial faith or cuſtoms, he had loſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57771:191"/>his credit with ſome, but he had ſaved his own ſoul, which now is becom as black as hell with ſlaunders, lyes, and uncharitable depravations both of their cuſtoms and immaculate Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What he can pervert and make ſport with, that he puts upon them for popery; and what he cannot, that muſt be thought no popery at all. But this I cannot now inſiſt upon. My let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is already grown too long.</p>
            <p>ANd yet I cannot but give you notice Sir, that even theſe things ſpecified here by your Diſſwader for popiſh novelties, as they are rightly underſtood in the catholik ſence and meaning; Indulgences; the real preſence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apperances or ſpecies of material ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols; Communion in one kind, Liturgy in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, greek or latin tongus, unknown general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vulgar people; Uſe and reſpect of images and ſacred figures; Spiritual Supremcay in one byſhop over the reſt; Saints invocation, and ſacrifice of maſs, are all acknowledged by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Proteſtant Reformers, for old errours, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, indeed but old, very old ones, a thouſand years older than your Diſſwader makes them, who would here make us beleev they are but freſh novelties.</p>
            <p>As for the antiquity of Indulgences, ſo far as they belong to Catholik beleef, I need not trouble my ſelf with further teſtimonies, then
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57771:191"/>the only one of your Diſſwader himſelf, who is <hi>inſtar omnium.</hi> For p. 17. he acknowledges their uſe to be <hi>ancient and primitive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the real preſence, Humpred in his Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſm ſayes, <hi>that Gregory the great,</hi> who lived a thouſand years ago, <hi>taught Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The Century writers Cent. 5. teach, that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> who was two hundred years before Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, <hi>is thought to confirm tranſubſtantiation:</hi> and Cent. 4. they place under the title <hi>of hurtful opinions and errours of the fathers,</hi> that ſaying of S. Greg. Nyſſen in his catechiſt ſermon de divino ſacramento, <hi>Not becaus it is eaten doth the bread becom the body of the word, but forthwith by the word it is changed into the body, as it is ſaid by the word, This is my body.</hi> And they ſay in the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury c. 10. <hi>That Euſebius, Emiſſenus did ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably of Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Antony de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damo in his anotomy of the maſs ſayes, <hi>That the book of Sacraments aſcribed to Ambroſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the opinion of Chriſts bodily preſence in the ſacrament.</hi> Peter Martyr in his defence, wholly <hi>diſlikes the judgment of St. Cyril in this point.</hi> Mr. Whitgift in his defence againſt Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, teſtifies of St. Ignatius diſciple to St. John the Evangeliſt, that he ſhould ſay of ſome hereticks in his time, <hi>That they do not admit Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſts and oblations, becaus they confeſs not the Euchariſt to be the fleſh of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, which fleſh ſuffered for our ſins,</hi> Adamus Franciſci
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57771:192"/>in his margarita theologica, ſaith, <hi>Commentum papiſtarum de tranſubſtantiatione maturè in eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am irrepſit.</hi> And Antony de Adamo in his anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Maſs, ſaith, <hi>I have not yet hitherto been able to know, when this opinion of the real and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily being of Chriſt in the Sacrament did begin.</hi> This then according to the acknowledgment of Proteſtants and thoſe very learned men, is no novelty.</p>
            <p>The indifferency of communion either in one kind or both is manifeſtly affirmed by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his epiſtle ad Bohemos, by Melanchton in his century of theological epiſtles, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Proteſtants, convinced therof by the current of primitive antiquity.</p>
            <p>That the Chriſtian Liturgy was in ancient times ever celebrated in Greek, Chaldee, Latin or other language unknown to vulgar Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in a part of the Church where lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not approach, and great part of it ſecretly, and out of the hearing of any body, and with much pomp of veſtments, gold and ſilver chalices, &amp;c. is amply teſtified by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Beza, in his eight epiſtle theological. And therfor Queen Elizabeth did not think ſhe acted againſt antiquity, when ſhe cauſed the Service to be read in Engliſh all over Wales, where the people underſtand it not. For which very ſame reaſon the great Cardinal Richlieu deſervedly taxed heretical miniſters (who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57771:192"/>at leaſt in outward ſhow, againſt this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtom) for their practiſing the very ſame thing, (as convinced in their own conſciences that it was the ancient practice) both in <hi>Bearn, Narbo, Province,</hi> and other places, where the miniſters of thoſe places read Service in the French Tongue, which was not the language of thoſe Provinces, nor by any of thoſe people any more underſtood, than is Latin by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of mankind. And yet the caſe is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in this affair affair amongſt Catholiks than other people. For theſe do but only come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear and attend to the Miniſter what he ſayes. But the Prieſts in the Catholik Church comes to make atonement for the people: which may well be done, ſo long as the ſaid people are in a general diſpoſition of heart fitly diſpoſed to preſent themſelvs before the face of their Lord for that end, whether they hear and know the ſighs and requeſts of their petitioner in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for them or no, ſo long as they are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they are of that true Church, by whom their prieſts are directed in their duty. For thus it was in the law of Moyſes dictated by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>There ſhall be no man,</hi> ſaith the ſacred text, Lev. 16. <hi>in the tabernacle of the congregation, when the prieſt goeth in to make an atonment in the holy place, untill he come out and have made an atonement for himſelf and for his houſhold, and for all the congregation of Iſrael.</hi> If God allowed
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57771:193"/>of this cuſtom four thouſand years ago, it can neither be a novelty nor ill.</p>
            <p>As for images and their due reſpect, the Magdeburgian Centuriators in their 4. Century teſtifie, <hi>That Lactantius affirms many ſuperſtitious things concerning the efficacy of Chriſts image.</hi> And in their 8. century, <hi>That S. Bede erred in the worſhipping of images.</hi> So Bale in his pageant of Popes ſayes, <hi>That Gregory by his indulgences eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed pilgrimages to images, and defended worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images.</hi> As alſo, <hi>That S. Leo allowed the worſhipping of Images.</hi> Functius another Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his chronology at 494. addes, <hi>That Xenaias who lived thirteen hundred years ago, was ſpecially noted and condemned for being the firſt that ſtirred up wars againſt images.</hi> This is then no novelty neither.</p>
            <p>As for Purgatory and prayer for the dead, Fulk in his Retentive affirms, <hi>That it prevailed within three hundred years after Chriſt.</hi> And in his confutation of Purgatory, <hi>That Ambroſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed prayer for the dead, and that it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour of his time.</hi> And again in the ſame book, <hi>That Chryſoſtom and Jerom allowed prayer for the dead:</hi> and in another place of the ſame book, <hi>That Auſtin blindly defended it:</hi> and again there, <hi>That Tertullian, Cyprian, Auſtin, Jerom, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others affirm, that ſacrifice for the dead is the tradition of the Apoſtles.</hi> As alſo he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged about ten pages before, in the ſame
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57771:193"/>book, <hi>That prayers for the dead is taught in the writings now extant under the name of Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi> mentioned in the acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which book, though he doubt whether it be his or no, yet himſelf writing againſt the Rhemiſh upon the 2. Theſſalonians, allows <hi>it to have been written above thirteen hundred years ago.</hi> Chemnitius in his Examen ſayes, <hi>That it was taught by Auſtin, Epiphanius, and Chryſoſtom:</hi> as nine pages before that, he had ſaid, <hi>It was taught by Origen, Ambroſe, Prudentius and Jerom.</hi> Mr. George Gifford in his Demonſtration ſayes, <hi>That it was generally in the Church long before Auſtin, as may be ſeen in Cyprian and Tertullian.</hi> And Bucer in his Enarrations upon the Goſpels ſpeaks, <hi>That prayer and alms were made for the dead almoſt from the very beginning of the Church.</hi> This is not a novelty then.</p>
            <p>As for Papal Superiority, the Proteſtant Centuriators acknowledg, <hi>That in the fift age of the Church,</hi> above a thouſand years ago, <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Byſhops applyed themſelves to eſtabliſh domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over other Churches;</hi> and, <hi>That they uſurped to themſelves right of granting priviledges and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to other Archbyſhops:</hi> and, <hi>That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Archbyſhops in their Sees:</hi> and, <hi>That they depoſed and excommunicated ſome, and abſolved others:</hi> That <hi>they arrogated power to themſelves of citing other Archbyſhops to declare their caus before them:</hi> That <hi>againſt a byſhop appealing to the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57771:194"/>Apoſtolick See, nothing ſhould be determined, but what the byſhop of Rome cenſured;</hi> That <hi>they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their legates in remote Provinces, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing autority to hear and determin all upriſing controverſies; eſpecially, in queſtions of faith:</hi> That <hi>they took upon them power of appointing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral councels, and to preſide therein, either by themſelves or their deputies, rejecting for unlawful thoſe Synods that were called without their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> They alſo adde in the ſame century, <hi>That Roman Byſhops had flatterers in thoſe times, who affirmed, that without permiſsion of the Roman by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop none might undertake the perſon of a judge.</hi> Nay, forgetting themſelves they averre in the ſame century, Collat. 775. <hi>That antiquity had attributed the principality of Prieſthood to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man byſhop above all.</hi> I could alledg alſo the like confeſſion of Beza, Mr. Whitgift, and Cartwright: but thoſe eminent Proteſtant Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiators may ſerv for all, who teſtifie further in that fifth century, That <hi>Victor called the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church the head of all Churches:</hi> That <hi>Turbius Aſturienſis flattered Pope Leo, and acknowledged his ſuperiority:</hi> That <hi>ſometimes byſhops condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Synods appealed to the See of Rome, as did,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Flavianus Patriarch of Conſtantinople in the Councel of Epheſus;</hi> and that <hi>Councels alſo requeſted to have their acts confirmed by the byſhop of Rome.</hi> And ſo indeed did not only Flavianus appeal to Pope Leo, but Talida Patriarch of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57771:194"/>Alexandria depoſed by the Emperour Zeno, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed alſo to Pope Simplicius; S. Athanaſius to Pope Julius; &amp;c. So did the Councel of Chalcedon requeſt to be confirmed by Pope Leo, the Councel of Carthage by Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the Councel of Epheſus by Pope Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The like ſuperiority of the Roman byſhop, not only over the neighbour Churches and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Italy, but over remote provinces, and the greateſt Archbyſhops and Patriarks of the world is acknowledged by Proteſtants to have been practiſed alſo before that, in the fourth age, when the Church firſt lift up her head by favour of Conſtantine the great, and appeared openly in the world. In this age ſay the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riators, <hi>the myſtery of iniquity was not idle.</hi> And they ſay alſo, that then <hi>the byſhop of Rome challenged by eccleſiaſtical canon, the diſallowing of thoſe Synods whereat they were abſent;</hi> That <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> a greek father, who lived about the latter end of this age, <hi>depoſed by the Councel of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, was reſtored to his byſhoprick by Pope Leo, unto whom he had made his appeal;</hi> and that <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom appealed likewiſe to Pope Innocentius, who thereupon decreed his adverſary Theophilus to be excommunicated and depoſed:</hi> That the famous and <hi>ancient Councel of Sardis,</hi> conſiſting of above 300. byſhops aſſembled from Spain, France, Italy, Sardinia, Greece, Egypt, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57771:195"/>Lybia, Paleſtin, Arabia, and ſundry other places of the world, and wherat ſundry fathers of the Nicen Councel were preſent, <hi>decreed appeals to the byſhop of Rome:</hi> for which fact <hi>the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riators blame the ſaid councel;</hi> as do alſo Oſian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Calvin, Peter Martyr and others. And laſtly, that wheras the Arrians had expelled Athanaſius byſhop of Alexandria, Paulus by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Conſtantinople, and other Catholick byſhops of the Eaſt, and brought their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Julius then byſhop of Rome, that he might ratifie what they had done, he, the ſaid byſhop <hi>ſummoned Athanaſius according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and when he had heard all ſides ſpeak, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored Athanaſius and his fellow byſhops to their own place; fretus eccleſiae Romanae praerogativa,</hi> as the Centuriſts there ſpeak.</p>
            <p>In the age before this, when raging perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſcured both the government and moſt of the written monuments of that time, yet want there not monuments of the Popes power in confirming, depoſing, reſtoring byſhops. Then it was, that S. Cyprian, as himſelf teſtifies, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Pope Stephen, by his letters to depoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus from his byſhoprick, and appoint another in his place; and he tells us likewiſe in his fourth epiſtle, how Baſilides went to Rome, hoping to beguile Pope Stephen then ignorant of the whole matter, ſo to procure himſelf to be reſtored to his byſhoprick, from which he
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57771:195"/>had been juſtly, ſaith S. Cyprian, depoſed. In this age the foreſaid learned Centuriators <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Pope Stephen for his undertaking to threaten excommunication to Helenus and Firmiltanus, and all others throughout Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Aſia for rebaptizing hereticks;</hi> they reprove alſo, as became Proteſtants to do, both S. Cyprian and Tertullian in this point; Tertullian for ſaying, <hi>that the keyes were committed to S. Peter, and the Church built on him;</hi> S. Cyprian, for affirming <hi>the Church to be built upon S. Peter, and one chair founded by our Lords voice upon the rock;</hi> for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Peters chair the principal Church, from whence Prieſtly unity ariſeth:</hi> and for ſaying, <hi>that there ought to be one byſhop in the Catholik Church; and that the Roman Church ought to be acknowledged of all other for the mother and root of the Catholik Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond age, the next after the apoſtles, wherof fewer monuments remain, yet be there ſome teſtimonies of this ſuperiority acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by Proteſtants. Pope <hi>Victor is owned</hi> even by our Mr. Whitgift in his defence, <hi>to be a godly byſhop and martyr, and the Church in his time in great purity, not being long after the apoſtles times;</hi> and yet Amandus Polonus a Proteſtant Profeſſour at Baſil ſayes in his theological the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the ſame Pope Victor, <hi>That he ſhewed a Papal mind and arrogancy:</hi> and Mr. Spark in his anſwer againſt John Albines, thinks him,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57771:196"/>
               <hi>ſomewhat Pope-like to have exceeded his bounds, when he took upon him to excommunicate the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Eaſt:</hi> and Whitaker charges him with <hi>exerciſing juriſdiction upon other Churches.</hi> So that theſe three Proteſtants diſcerned a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power even in this ſecond pure age of the Church, although they liked it not. But the Proteſtant Centuriators do much except againſt a ſaying of S. Irenaeus, who lived in this age next after the apoſtles, and might well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the apoſtles own lively preachings, (as Hamelmannus a Proteſtant writer in his book of traditions, ſpeaks both of Irenaeus and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp) recorded in the third chapter of his third book, <hi>Ad hanc enim eccleſiam Romanam, propter potentiorem principalit atem neceſſe eſt omnem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire eccleſiam; It is neceſſary, that every other Church,</hi> ſaith Irenaeus, <hi>comply with the Roman, by reaſon of her greater principality.</hi> Firſt, becaus he ſayes <hi>it is neceſſary;</hi> ſecondly, that <hi>every Church;</hi> thirdly, for the <hi>Roman Church's more potent principality,</hi> to comply with her, the Centuriſts are much diſpleaſed at it, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it for a very corrupt ſpeech. And indeed the papal power and juriſdiction was ſo eminent in all ages, that Philip Nicolai in his comment de regno Chriſti, <hi>reſers the beginning of it to the infirmity of the Apoſtles, and byſhops ſucceeding them.</hi> For there ſpeaking of the origin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas of papal power, <hi>Primatus affectatio,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57771:196"/>he, <hi>communis fuit infirmitas apoſtolorum, ac etiam primorum urbis epiſcoporum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, in the firſt age, that St. Peter had a primacy above the other apoſtles, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Calvin; <hi>The twelve apoſtles had one among them to govern the reſt;</hi> by Muſculus, <hi>The celeſtial ſpirits are not equal, the apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not equal, Peter is found in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have been chief amongſt the reſt, which we deny not;</hi> by Mr. Whitgift, <hi>Amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves ther was one chief;</hi> and by Dr. Covel, who in his examinations, teaches at large againſt the Puritans, both that <hi>there was one appointed over the reſt amongſt the apoſtles to keep them in unity;</hi> and that <hi>that government was not to ceas with the apoſtles, but ever to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Church;</hi> and that it is the <hi>only way to prevent diſſention, and ſuppreſs hereſies;</hi> and that otherwiſe <hi>the Church would be in a far wors caſe, than the meaneſt Commonwealth, nay almoſt than a den of thieves.</hi> But the Centuriſts like not this, and therfor do they in their 4. Cent. reprehend many of the Fathers, for entituling Peter <hi>the head of the apoſtles, and the byſhop of byſhops.</hi> So indeed Optatus calls him <hi>apoſtolorum caput,</hi> and therfor <hi>Cephas;</hi> Origen <hi>apoſtolorum principem;</hi> Cyril of Jeruſalem, <hi>principem &amp; caput caeterorum;</hi> Cyril of Alexandria, <hi>Paſtorem &amp; caput eccleſiae;</hi> Arnobius <hi>Epiſcoporum epiſcopum;</hi> the Councel of Chalcedon, <hi>Petram &amp; verticem eccleſiae Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae.</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:57771:197"/>Thus much for that point; which by all this is proved to be far from any novelty.</p>
            <p>As for Saints invocation, and the antiquity of that beleef and cuſtom, it is acknowledged by the Centuriſts, Chemnitius, our Dr. Whitgift, and Fulk. Dr. Whitgift in his defence hath theſe words, <hi>Almoſt all the byſhops and writers of the Greek Church and Latin alſo, for the moſt part were ſpotted with doctrins of Free-will, of merit, of invocation of Saints, and ſuch like.</hi> Fulk in his rejoynder to Briſtow, <hi>I confeſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Ambroſe, Auſtin, and Jerom held invocation of Saints to be lawful:</hi> and in his book againſt the Rhemiſh Teſtament, <hi>In Nazianzen, Baſil, and Chryſoſtom I confeſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is mention of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints:</hi> and again, <hi>that Theodoret alſo ſpeaketh of prayers to martyrs:</hi> and again in the ſame book, <hi>that Leo aſcribeth much to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of S. Peter for him:</hi> and again, <hi>that many ancient fathers held, that Saints departed pray for us.</hi> Chemnitius in his examen, acknowledges as much of <hi>S. Baſil, Nazianzen, Gregory Nyſſen, Theodoret, S. Jerom, and even S. Auſtin himſelf.</hi> The Centuriſts charge the ſame <hi>upon S. Cyprian,</hi> who is ancienter than S. Auſtin; and again <hi>upon Origen,</hi> who was ancienter than Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: adding, that there are manifeſt ſteps of Saints invocation in the doctors of that ancient age. So, this is no novelty then.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, as for the Sacrifice of Maſs, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57771:197"/>Altars, (which as Dr. Reynolds ſayes well in his conference with Hart, are linked together) Peter Martyr in his common places, <hi>reproveth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Alexandria for attributing more,</hi> as he ſpeaks, <hi>to the outward altar, than to the living temples of Chriſt:</hi> and he checks <hi>Optatus</hi> alſo for ſaying, <hi>what is the altar? even the ſeat of the body and blood of Chriſt; ſuch ſayings as theſe,</hi> ſaith Peter Martyr, <hi>edified not the people;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>all the fathers in general he finds fault with, for their abuſing ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the name Altar;</hi> which indeed is ſpoken of even by S Ignatius, the Apoſtles undoubted ſchollar, <hi>who is therfor carped at</hi> by Cartwright.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57771:198"/>ſacrifice.</hi> And our own Aſcham in his <hi>Apologet. pro coena Domini,</hi> is found to acknowledg, <hi>that ſacrifice for the dead and living is ſo ancient in the Chriſtian Church, that no beginning of it can be found:</hi> although he thinks alſo with Calvin, that it was derived, whenſoever it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, from the cuſtom either of the Jews or Gentiles, or both; thus beſpattering with his raſh pen the very firſt ſproutings of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the world. However it is in the mean time no novelty at leaſt.</p>
            <p>And let any one in any age of Chriſtianity look all over the Chriſtian world, on any of thoſe who profeſs that name, whether they kept communion with the Roman Church, or brake by ſchiſme from it, or perhaps never heard of it, as they ſay the Church in Ethiopia did not, and he ſhall find that they all had this Chriſtian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice amongſt them, as the great capital work of their Religion. The <hi>Grecians</hi> under their Patriarch of Conſtantinople even ſtill after their ſchiſme have their Prieſts celebrating in all their ancient robes this their ſacred liturgy to this day in the learned greek tongue all over the world where they live, and may ſerv God, not only in Greece, Epirus, Macedon and iſlands of the Egoean ſea, but in many parts of Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Circaſſia, Ruſſia, Thrace, Bulgaria, Raſcia, Servia, Boſnia, Walachia, Moldavia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Thracia, and up as far North as Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſond.

Nor do they know any other way of ſerving or appeaſing the Almighty in order to heavenly bliſs, than this propiatory ſacrifice, which received from their forefathers they practiſe and exerciſe to this day. And this was ever the great devotion of all Chriſtians, and ſtill is, excepting only ſome few here in the North who have gone out of that primitive Chriſtianity, the laſt age, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the unhappy ſteps of Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin; and not all of them neither. For Luther, although he fouled, yet did he not throw down the altar: and the pure Lutherans that be yet in Germany, Denmark and Sweathland, keep it up ſtill.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir have other Proteſtants admitted all that to be ancient, which this your Diſſwader
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57771:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>calls a novelty unheard of in ancient times. Nay Luther and Calvin eſteemed all Popery an old Egyptian darknes ſpread over the face of the Church all ages ſince the Apoſtles dayes, and diſſipated at length by that new light which they revealed. It is a ſtrange thing that Popery which in Luther and Calvins dayes was old, ſhould now after a hundred years be grown young again. But when Proteſtancy was new, then Popery was old; and now Popery muſt be thought new, when Proteſtancy is grown old and rotten. Truth is, it was the Miniſters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to acknowledg Popery to be old, when <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> where Catholik Religion ſpread all over <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e earth, had all her monuments intire by her, to ſhow her antiquity to all people then living; who had alſo heard of the Catholik faith of their anceſtours; although they made it by ſlight of fallacious oratory erroneous. But here and now in England, where all thoſe monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are deſtroyed, it is a double convenience to ſay, that Popery is erroneous and new too. When the firſt Reformers endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the Catholik profeſſours of their means and livings, it was beſt to accuſe them of old errours. But now to keep their livings they have invaded, it is a wiſer part it ſeems, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt Popery as a novelty. There no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty could no way be proved; and here in England antiquity cannot eaſily be ſhown.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57771:200"/>Then matter of fact would have diſproved novelty; now matter of fact will not prove an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity here in this Kingdom, where the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religion is abrogated about a hundred years ago; and people now alive that behold Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, never ſaw Catholick Religion, and are almoſt perſwaded by their miniſters there was never any ſuch thing here. Nor will people read Catholik authors, nor beleev them if they do; nor have they power to conſider who built all their Churches, or made their laws, or any other good thing done for them by Catholik beleevers, but take all Papiſts to be in a manner Atheiſts, becaus they com not to hear their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters talk in thoſe Churches from whence poor Catholiks were firſt ſolemnly baniſht; and then within a while after were puniſhed for not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there; at ſuch a time, when their altar, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and prieſthood were now aboliſhed, and their prieſts put to death, and others made li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it afterwards, when ever they ſhould come into thoſe Churches again to do their functions; and miniſters had got into their places to rail againſt them and that holy anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Religion, which had built thoſe Churches to their hands.</p>
            <p>Ther is I think no better way imaginable to diſcover the natur of the ancient Chriſtian Church, than by conſidering what was ſaid to be her beleef and practice then, when firſt ſhe
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57771:200"/>dared to ſhow her face openly in the world, appearing at length as it were from under ground and her former lurking condition, wherin ſhe had remained three hundred years under the cruel perſecution of Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. As ſoon as Conſtantin the Great, Gods heavenly grace ſo moving him, had firſt taken this holy Church by the hand, and cloathed her with her ornaments of peace, then ſurely ſhe would appear her ſelf. And what ſhe was then, may be eaſily gathered by ſuch ancient writers, who either purpoſely ſpake of the life of Conſtantin, or incidentally of the things which were done in thoſe dayes, as Euſebius, Zozomen, S. Jerom, Bede, and others; who deliver us the form and features of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church in thoſe times, ſo like unto the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery that is now adayes, after thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, both in the particulars Dr. Taylor ſpeaks of, and ſeveral others now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by our Proteſtant Reformation; that a man may ſafely ſwear, that the now preſent Popery and old Chriſtianity are one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Euſebius tells us, how Conſtantin the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour after the faſhion of thoſe good times, chaſtiſed his own body with faſting and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines; how he uſed to bleſs himſelf, and ſign his face with the ſign of the Croſs; how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he honoured and ſet up that triumphal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57771:201"/>having confidence of victory in vertue therof; how he erected illuſtrious temples in memory of the Chriſtian martyrs; how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſit down in the general Councel of Nice, till the Prelates there had given their conſent; how he dedicated a ſumptuous Church in memory of the apoſtles, and provided there a ſepulchre for himſelf, to the end that after his death he might be partaker of the prayers there offered; how he aſſembled the prieſts to the dedication of his temple, wherof ſome preached, others offered ſacrifice for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace, for the Church of God, and for the Emperour; and laſtly how in his ſickneſs he confeſt his ſins in a chappel of the martyrs, and prayer and ſacrifice made for his ſoul after his deceas.</p>
            <p>Zozomen in his hiſtory tells us alſo of him, that becaus thoſe primitive Chriſtians uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated places, and only them for their publick Liturgy, Conſtantin had ever carried with him in the camp a portable altar and tabernacle, and prieſts and deacons attending it, for cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of divine myſteries; how much alſo he honoured the holy monk S. Anthony for the great auſterities of his life; how he would have all conciliar deciſions to be regarded as moſt firm and unalterable; and that he would not undertake the judgment of eccleſiaſtical cauſes; and that he had great veneration for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57771:201"/>the ſign of the Croſs. Theſe and ſuch like things ſpeaks Zozomen.</p>
            <p>So likewis, that Churches and Altars were conſecrated in the time of Conſtantin the Great, with the ſign of the Croſs and ſprinkling of holy water amongſt other Catholik rites and ceremonies, is witneſſed by S. Auſtin and S. Bede. That Conſtatin the Emperour tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Conſtantinople the holy reliques of S. Andrew, S. Luke, and S. Timothy, at which the devils even audibly yelled and roared out, is aſſerted by S. Jerom. That the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in all his glory went to kiſs the Martyrs Sepulchres, humbly praying thoſe Saints, that they would be interceſſours to God for him, is told us by S. Chryſoſtom. And laſtly, that in Conſtantins dayes the Popes authority was acknowledged and reverenced, is apparent by the great Synod of Arles then celebrated, who decreeing that Eaſter ſhould be uniformly kept, intreated Pope Sylveſter, to direct his letters according to the Churches cuſtom all the world over for that end.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Century writers of Magdeburg, enemies of the Catholik Church, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Proteſtants, that they have been ſtiled by their followers, <hi>Men worthy of eternal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> even theſe do write of Conſtantin, (though with a deſign to diminiſh his honour) that he appointed a great holiday for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57771:202"/>dedication, which we in Engliſh call a <hi>Wake:</hi> that he favoured conſecrations and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious exornations of Churches; that he with other Chriſtians in thoſe times met for Gods ſervice only in conſecrated places: that he would have candles to burn in Churches in the day time; that ſuperſtitiouſly he ſent to Conſtantinople ſome reliques of the Croſs found by his mother Helena, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the City; that in Conſtantins time pilgrimages were much in uſe, and that his mother Helena went to the holy land to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: that Prieſts were forbid to marry by the Synod of Arles, in the time of Emperour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin and Pope Sylveſter: that both under Conſtantin and long before his time were both Monks and Nuns ſpread all over Aſia, Syria, Paleſtin, Aegypt, Bithynia, &amp;c. that Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin did ſo reverence Byſhops, that he would not ſit amongſt them in the Nicen Councel, but in a lower ſeat: That the ſaid Emperour checked Akeſius for denying Prieſts to have power of forgiving ſins, bidding him ſet up a ladder for himſelf, and go up to heaven his own way all alone: and laſtly, that after his death they poured out tears and prayes every where for the Emperours ſoul.</p>
            <p>And other Proteſtant writers many of them ſince, as Napper for example in an Engliſh treatiſe upon the Revelations, and Frigivillaeus
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57771:202"/>in a latin one called <hi>Palma Chriſtiana,</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Queen Elizabeth, convinced by ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable teſtimonies every where obvious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Chriſtian Church in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins time to have been wholly Papiſtical. <hi>After the year of God three hundred,</hi> ſaith Napper, <hi>the Emperour Conſtantin ſubjugated all Chriſtian Churches to Pope Sylveſter, from which time till theſe our dayes the Pope and his Clergy have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the outward viſible Church.</hi> And Frigivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus in his wrath calls therupon the noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Conſtantin, the great Dragon who gave power to the Beaſt. Take it all in their own words.</p>

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57771:206"/>wives from husbands, and children from parents. And thus he concludes his third plea againſt Popery, ending his book with a prayer, <hi>That the Lord would give his reader underſtanding.</hi>

               <p>He prayes to his own ruin. For if the reader of his book have underſtanding, the writer of it will utterly loſe his credit. And is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Dr. Taylor ſhould have ſo low opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of us all, as to expoſe ſuch talk as this to the view of three nations? He wrote indeed firſt and principally for thoſe Iriſh people that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his charge; and he has it may be ſome ſuch opinion of them, as I remember I had, when being a boy I firſt heard talk of the wild Iriſh. But we are now men, and ſhould put away ſuch childſh things. Neither they nor we, are ſo wild or ſimple, as Dr. Taylor—takes us to be.</p>
               <p>How he has behaved himſelf in his firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherin he would prove Popery, that is to ſay, Catholik Religion neither apoſtolik nor primitive. I have told you Sir more at large. Now I tell you briefly, concerning theſe two chapters, that ther is not ſo much as any the leaſt parcel of popery propoſed to be confuted therin. But he either depraves and ſlanders their religion; or impoſes, what no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it; which is injuſtice on both hands. But their diſcredit will promote his applaus;
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57771:207"/>and he cares not how it be effected. He is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, if they be miſunderſtood, and himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be their enemy. For then, the better part of the land will hold him up, and the other not go about to pull him down. And therfor that all may joyn with him in the deriſion of this ſame <hi>Ecce homo,</hi> he firſt like a Jew puts a reed into the Papiſts hand, and then laughs at the featous ſcepter.</p>
               <p>All this whole book of Dr. Taylors, and three parts of all the other books that have ever been written ſince the Reformation againſt Popery, might be ſufficiently anſwered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending to particulars, and totally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by one general diſcours of <hi>the nature and poperties of ſchool-divinity,</hi> whence the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Catholik faith cull out all their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drolleries, when they make their rhetorical diſcourſes againſt Popery, to blind the Land, and abuſe good people. And I had it in my heart, when I firſt ſet pen to paper, to do it fully; ſo much in my heart, that I made but little account in compariſon of all the other things I had to ſpeak. But I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the length of a letter, and ſhall take ſome other time for that diſcours. Only take notice Sir, that Dr. Taylor, and ſuch like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant writers do as fond and unjuſtly herein, as that Catholik would do, who undertaking to write againſt proteſtancy, ſhould never take
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57771:207"/>notice either of the principles of reformation, or of the articles, canons, or conſtitutions, for example, of our Engliſh Church, but only pick out here and there ſome few words of this or that obſcure miniſters book, found up and down in the Stationers ſhops in Oxford, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg, or London, and call a heap of ſuch ſtuff, ſwerving perhaps from the Proteſtancy he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by the name of <hi>Proteſtant-doctrin.</hi> Thus do all Proteſtants deal with popery. Not a word do we hear when any one of them writes againſt it, of their ſubſtantial Religion, which is in the hearts and hands of all Catholiks, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by goſpel, tradition, and councels, and juſtified by the univerſal practice and judgments of all men in the world who profeſs that faith, which only is popery and Catholik profeſſion; but only ſom deviations either in the words or manners of ſome one or other that have lived amongſt them: and this is that they call <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſſwaſive of Dr. Taylors is wholly nothing els: only with this difference, that the ſubject and heads of his firſt chapter is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that pertains to Catholik faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, though in ſpeaking of them he utterly ſwerves from the purpos: but in his other two chapters, both what he ſpeaks and what he ſpeaks of, is utterly impertinent. But thus is malice and miſapprehenſion againſt Catholiks
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57771:208"/>and their Religion moſt holy and innocent, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed up and down in mens hearts, to the ruin of charity, and a right underſtanding in this Land.</p>
               <p>But my Proteſtant Countreymen, thoſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech not to be too credulous. And my Catholik Countreymen I moſt fervently beg of them, ſtill more and more to beleev and hope and truſt in God, who in his good time will juſtifie his own religion, and all his poor ſervants that profeſs it. We muſt ſtill remember in what a world we live, and be willing for our beloved Lord to ſuffer contumelies here, in all reſignation and peace. He that can do this is a conquerour of himſelf, and lord of the world, a friend of Chriſt, and heir of heaven.</p>
               <p>This is all, Sir, I either mean or need to ſpeak at this time, concerning this Diſſwaſive. Try all things, and hold what is right. Truth like the ſun will ſoon appear to an open, unveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and clear eye: but prejudice leads us blind-fold unto ruin. Nor muſt you ſtay, Sir, till our good miniſters tell you, that you and they are in an errour. Though an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould convince them of it; yet can he not by any argument perſwade them to leave a wife and five hundred pound a year for a poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and naked truth. It were in the mean time a thing I ſhould think of much wiſdom in them, not to write any books againſt Papiſts. For
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57771:208"/>they do but loſe by that publick ſlander, which comes to Catholik eyes, all that varniſh of vain glory, which they procure themſelvs by private calumnies caſt upon them in the pulpit, which Catholiks never hear of. Some one or other amongſt thoſe papiſts may haply think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and no wayes againſt the rules of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to refute their folly. And then the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is loſt. That moſt honourable authority, which forbids Catholiks to write any books, forbids others by a tacit conſequence, to ſlander them. For the law of God and nature ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and ſomtimes commands, the innocent to juſtifie themſelves, and clear their injured repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Farewell.</p>
